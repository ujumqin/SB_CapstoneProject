These problems have largely been solved in modern games and operating systems, so there is generally very little reason to opt for borderless windowed anymore if you're playing on the whole size of your monitor.With that background out of the way, we can move on to your question.  Yes, you are losing those full screen optimizations running in windowed mode, but this is vastly overshadowed by the fact that your graphics processor needs to render fewer pixels due to the lowered effective screen resolution your game is playing at.  This makes a huge difference.  If every frame is that much smaller (in resolution) it's much easier for a system under strain to make more of them, faster.

Try out all the different heroes so you at least get a feel for what their kits do. After that, see which ones you like and focus on them. Most of the skills you need for overwatch will just naturally come with time and experience. Try to hone your general awareness, whether that be listening to what's going on around you, what threats are present, looking at the kill feed to see how your team is faring, what ults your team has up, what ults the enemy team might have up, etc. Having good awareness will lead to having good game sense.Always try to play the objective, the objective is the number one priority and it is also what many newer players neglect. Learn how to analyse the objective timer as it can be confusing to understand for beginners. For example, overtime will start to tick if you guys are on 99% and the other team is on 0 but still contesting. Whilst your gut reaction may be to panic and try to touch point - that is often the wrong decision. Instead, realise that your team only needs 1% more and it is ok to let the enemy cap the point in order to regroup as a team and push together. On the flip side, recognise which overtimes mean TOUCH the point and STAY on the point using whatever means possible. It is all too common to pull a c9 - meaning that a team has the opportunity to contest the point but don't do so and lose the game. If you notice that your team is pushed all the way up but the point hasn't been capped, sit on the point and cap it yourself. If you notice there is nobody on payload, let your team know or sit on it yourself. Trickling is BAD. Don't trickle, don't let your team trickle, spam that group up button when you notice people are just going onto the point one by one and dying. Sorry about the long ass essay, I'm on a flight atm so I have a lot of time. These are just some general things to look out for but if you have hero specific questions, I can try to answer those as well. ",1,"natural",1,1

People make a lot of mistakes in all tiers of this game.  Watch for them and try to punish them. Try not to make the same mistake twice yourself. If you aren't sure yet what is a mistake, just ask yourself the following: Am I really far from my team? Is that enemy alone? Is that enemy not looking at you? Capitalize on these things.2) Group up. There's safety in numbers. If people keep going in by themselves, pick someone (like a tank) to go with, this is now your buddy and you want to keep them alive. Protect them, try to help them make a play.And always have fun! Skill in anything is a learned trait, you will get there.",1,"mistakes",-2,1

A hit box is simply put, just more detailed collision that follows the skeleton (in this example). The players capsule is also a collider. Adding a hitbox, or collider, to an instant, AoE ability - doesn't make much sense. You could just trace towards multiple locations on the player for a more accurate check.Either way this is very intended by blizzard as it puts the favour in the potential victim. The alternative would be hypothetically dying because your toe was creeping a bit too much, which just feels shitty.The player has a good grasp of where the centre of their characters capsule is, as it is center screen.

But they never explain what an Omnic is and they never explain whether the Omnic's are good or bad (or what relevance they have to the Overwatch story). You get from context that there was a war against the Omnic's so the casual observer would assume that Zen is a bad guy, probably. It's just never really clear what audience they are trying to explain the Overwatch characters to. It never get in depth enough to target people who play the game but it's all too confusing and insubstantial enough to target people who haven't played it.",1,"perfect",3,1

As it stands in this video, I don't understand how any of the heroes relate to each other (outside of the individual family relationships that were explained).

I had originally written it for /r/overwatchuniversity (but had also always intended for /u/vandalmunroe to use it for his website) and people there were saying that 'communication is a net negative,' so I wrote a 'small' edit to my original post. I'll copy it here in case anyone wants to read that as well. In the comments, some people have been saying that they have felt that communicating only tends to tilt people. This can be because of a variety of things. Those people could have already been tilted and are venting their frustrations on the 'tryhard' (shouldn't we all be tryharding in competitive?) for example. It could also be that the player who is communicating is being too condescending or argumentative about it (often without realizing it) even though they do mean well. Then there is also the fact that some people are just playing their own game and have next to zero interest in actually working with their team, which (to me) is entirely the wrong way of going about a competitive OW game.If you queue up in competitive (which is by all accounts the most 'serious' way of playing the game for most players) in Overwatch, which is a multiplayer only team based game, I think that there should be a certain willingness to be a team player and work with your team. I am not saying that people should be playing heroes they really don't want to play or have no playtime on and be the lackey of their team, but there is a middle ground between that and blatantly ignoring the input of your team and just doing whatever the hell you want, including getting mad when someone does want to work as a team. This is partially covered in the 'mind your attitude' part of the guide though.Either way: it is important to get a feel for your team. If a certain player really doesn't handle your suggestion to switch off well then it's probably best to leave it at that, for example. Millions of people play this game and as such there's tons of different personality types behind those screens. Much as in real life it's important that you are able to 'read the room'.It is also possible to 'force yourself' on your team too hard. It is fine to communicate regular stuff (basic health callouts, ults, ...) but if you try to babysit your team a little too hard then there's a possibility that that doesn't sit well with the enemy team. Remember that no one elected you as their leader, so it's not your responsibility to steer the team and have all of them play to your ideas. If you are calling the shots a bit and people are listening and agreeing, then great, keep doing that. But if you feel like your team wants to go a different route then go along with the team. It's a team game, there is no set hierarchy, you're all on the same level of the leadership pyramid.There is also definitely the possibility that you are communicating too much. As with almost anything, moderation is key. There's no need to call out that McCree used his roll when he exited spawn, or that Tracer used one blink, for example. Aside from that, some groups of people naturally prefer a more laid back style of comms (just saying whatever is really necessary) whilst some will have no problem with a more 'professional' style of communication. Again; reading the room is important.Edit conclusionI don't want to pull any rank card or sound like a grandpa, but I've been playing competitive games for the better part of a decade now and communication is something which leads to good results (or at least causes no extra troubles) 95% of the time in my opinion. It's definitely very important to 'read the room' when you're playing with randoms though, and that is a skill that will come with time. Some people are 'beyond help' (people who are already tilted from a loss streak, very selfish/arrogant players, trolls, ...) but that's just the nature of people, that's not a downside of communicating in itself.It is important to also look at yourself as well. If you find that more than half of your teammates get angry with you after a while then it's probably best to take a look at how exactly you're communicating. No matter how well you mean it, you could be coming off as a smug bastard to them or you could be yelling stuff which really doesn't matter at all.All in all I firmly believe that being able to communicate properly (which also means knowing what you can and can't say to certain teammates and so on) is a very valuable skill. You don't have to be talking all the time (I don't do that either) and as with everything there are nuances to it. You're playing with real people with real feelings and personalities after all, not with robots. Some people prefer to be silent and just listen in and that's fine as well, but I wholeheartedly disagree with the notion that getting on comms somehow always (or the majority of the time) has a negative effect on your team. That doesn't rhyme with my experiences and it doesn't rhyme with what I see on the streams I watch every day either.",1,"negative",-2,1

I'm of the opinion that it's always better to at least make super necessary callouts (like a flanking Reaper with ult or whatever who hasn't been seen by anyone in your team) but I understand that there are people who'd rather not talk due to a variety of reasons. Completely shutting off the chat of other people by default is something which I think is rather silly though. Initially it might help you to focus on your game if you just turn everything off, but remember that OW is a team game and you team's input can genuinely mean the difference between winning or losing a game.I also think that being able to listen to team chat whilst playing the game is a skill which needs to be trained before you can do it perfectly. If it's really so beneficial to just mute everything then why don't pro teams do that, for instance? Another comment on here went something along the lines of 'how is communicating with my team gonna help me win a 1v1 with a flanker' and the answer is that it won't help you win that 1v1 in that instance (though communicating it may save your life due to someone peeling for you or whatever) but to me that's a bit of a lazy (I don't mean that offensively) way of thinking. For example; I play soccer. Why would I try to look up at the field as often as possible when running with the bal when I can just look at my feet the entire team, making it way easier? This just to say that, yes, it might be easier to look at your feet, but you'll lose valuable info on the position of your teammates and the opposition. Once you've practiced enough it becomes second nature to look up as much as possible as opposed to looking at your feet.The same goes for OW. Yeah, it might be easier to shut everything off and 'just focus on your own play' but that comes at the cost of not hearing possible gamesaving calls, not being able to call out very important stuff which can win you games, ... I've been gaming for a long time and now I can easily talk and listen to other players without it being a major hindrance to me. You can look at players like Emongg if you want an example of a player who is constantly talking and listening and still performing very well. Now of course if your team consists of a bunch of trolls blaring music and farting noises through their mics whilst raging at each other then you can turn it all off, but I think shutting off communications entirely by default isn't the right way to go. TL;DR: I'd say shutting off all comms by default is a mistake. It might be easier for you to play without all of these 'distractions' but once you get used to it it's not a distraction any longer. Perhaps a silly example to illustrate my point: it's easier to ride a bike with training wheels because you're not being distracted by the whole 'trying to stay upright' thing, but if you want to become a decent/pro cyclist you're gonna have to take off the training wheels sooner or later.",1,"better",2,1

Probably my funnest games I have ever played in comp.Before the rounds I seen we went the basic 2/2/2 comp right off the bat which was great!! So I told the flanker to flank the team and the rest stick together behind our Rein and they all said ""understood"" with the quick msgs.Then when we started I made all the callouts of the enemy flankers and my tanks helped me out Rein saved me several times. Oh forgot to mention I was playing Moira.Also I stuck to being positive through the whole match thanking for the heals from our Mercy of Lucio, (they swapped for some rounds). Thanked the tanks for blocking for me. Everyone used the quick msg to thank me or say understood which made me aware they were listening and loved my strategy and callouts.I ended the first match only dying once and had 30 elims. the second match I had 40 elims and only died 3 times. We swept both matches, getting 3 checkpoints when the other teams never reached the first checkpoint.So to add to your write up, even if you are not communicating yourself. At least go in to team chat to listen in case someone else is in there to help by making callouts etc. It helps a ton!",1,"amazing",4,1

I heard russian language spoken on mic.

He had recently switched from console to PC and almost every game on console is played open mic.  He DID NOT want to make the switch to push to talk initially. Got complaints almost every game. It was awkward to watch. I’m guessing the thought of having to interrupt yourself with pressing the button was non-intuitive and just not something he wanted to get used to. He was already in high level play.  I mean it will get you killed from time to time and me and him made the same transition so I know the glorious freedom of open mic. He was calm on comms, made call outs, switched when needed. He didn’t defend his main (seen as viable only on select maps at the time...Eich, Dorado defense etc...) — he sold him.  The attempt he made was to not create a toxic or hopeless atmosphere at the beginning of the game JUST because of his pick.  I only watched a few of his streams in the super early days so thats what i’m basing this off of. I was wondering if someone who was not already established or a pro ever had a chance of making it. FWIW I left thinking “he’s trying too hard” (to make it.) Welp.But anyways, imagine instalocking Junk and not saying a word back then. You just communicated ALOT and it wasn’t good.

It's unfortunately so incredibly common for people to scapegoat someone else or blame some outside force, get tilted and babyrage all over voice or text. I've watched so many games go from our favor to auto-loss due to people getting triggered after losing a team fight because they didn't get healed, or &lt;most off-meta hero&gt; didn't last-hit everyone so they don't show up in the kill feed or something stupid like that.I suppose reeling that in is part of the communication thing (and something you touch on), but it'd be rad if people would control those emotions entirely and not tilt at all.",1,"like",2,1

Communication can help you win a game but talking and listening to the team distracted me so I couldn't really focus on what actually makes you climb. Not just winning games but improving yourself because that is what the skill rating represents.For example I won't learn how to beat a flanker by making a call out while losing focus on aiming. It might be easier for others to multitask talking/listening and playing but personally it helped me a lot to stop me from thinking more about what to say than about what to do.But note that I am playing flex support (all 5 healers) and therefore mostly don't need to communicate while picking a hero and also have enough information about my teams positioning because I can see their silhouettes.Another aspect is that you lose out on all the toxicity that might occur but of course also on all the opportunities to talk to awesome people which is one of the best parts of Overwatch.",1,"help",2,1

As a general rule of thumb you should try to never react to something and let your frustration shine through. Creating a bad vibe in a team is the shortest way to a loss, because tilted people will always play worse. If your Mercy blatantly missed your multiple calls for healing and you were standing right next to her then you have every right to be a little upset, but don't let it shine through in your comms too much. It's okay to tell someone you think they did something wrong (and you should be able to take constructive criticism as a player in a competitive game mode) but never resort to flaming or any sort of abuse. There are people who are able to shrug stuff like that off, but mostly you will only generate an equally hostile response or cause people to start playing worse (i.e. 'tilting' them) and that is the shortest way to a loss.This is the most important piece of advice out the entire post. I've played way to many games where someone will mess up one tiny thing and people will instantly start to flame and tilt off of it. At the end of the day, its a game and we're all trying to have fun. Flaming others and becoming tilted over small mistakes shows you aren't mature enough to play in a competitive environment.

A bezier curve that is slow at the start then moves towards the next keyframe faster as it gets closer produces an effect that is very satisfying for say, a blacksmith striking his metal or other organic movements.Bastion in this case is a jittery robot, it is very likely that they used linear(constant speed) speeds inbetween each keyframe to fit the animation style better.The bird being in the same animation, (in theory) is being affected by this linear timing, making it seem like horrible animation when its actually just a limitation of the animation.the more you knowtm",1,"fit",1,1

Doing one does not usually slow the other down.Truth is that it's just not possible to neatly clean up the top 500 list as long as smurfing is allowed. And they can't do much about smurfs (IP/MAC is not reliable data for identifying them), and even if they could, they shouldn't as long as they get to the mmr where they belong quickly. At this point I'm pretty sure they make a ton of cash with people who repurchase the game several times just to play against newbies for 15 levels, and from a business perspective it probably wouldn't be wise to forbid it (again, as long as they get to their mmr quickly).",1,"want",1,1

It seems like for many games, there are people who do nothing in life but play them and many of them get some sort of money.  While this can be based on them being good at the game or at gaming in general, other times its because they arent good at anything else.  I recall XQC having a deep talk about how he has invested so much into playing games because he isnt good with math and he isnt good with other things that most normal people are, and that he has to put all his time into gaming because if not then he will never find work since games ARE the only thing he is good with.  Without making money from gaming, he will have nothing to put on a resume that has any real worth to it if things dont work out for him in the gaming world.Honestly, I think the idea of gaming for life is a really risky idea.  Most people who are pro gamers are very young but when they get older, the new generation of young gamers will push them to their limits and soon they will be replaced.  Now what do they do with their lifes?   I mean sure playing games sounds more fun than doing engineering work, like what I do, but my work contributes to society and my job security is very safe since finding work as an engineer is not too hard (well, its hard at first but once you get going, its not that bad).",1,"agree",1,1

You can't just take one piece of a characters role during a fight and calling it their whole playstyle.

As a Zarya with an ult, you can bait vital ults to open the window for another teams ult. Ex. Know their Zenyatta has an ult? Use your ult to use up their ult when he's not in full position to take him out of the fight, opening the door to a soldier ult, Genji ult, etc. Same goes for solo ulting a Mercy. Solo ulting can open the window for your team ults to go uncountered and uncontested. ",1,"fight",-1,1

It's very difficult to track where people are when I uppercut two of them under a bridge and get bounced around and shit, and his CD's are so fast I often forget that his punch just came back up. You use it to engage but it's back up mid-fight too.  And unfortunately, he has such a positive feedback loop.
