89,https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20752619458,How do I know if someone I reported gets banned?,NA,"It would be quite unethical to do so, you reported it and blizzard is the neutral party between you, and the accused. Anything that happens beyond that point is entirely between the accused and blizzard. Apart from that I believe blizzard would not ban/punish for a single game where that occured, unless the person was using a hack that was registered by ingame detections as well, and that is a good thing as anyone can have a moment where their composure slipped and by murphy's law push to talk was on during that time. KYS is a stretch and sounds like something they would do on a regular basis if they have no qualms with saying that though. Therefore any reports from within the same game should probably count less than from 2 seperate instances. If that doesn't satisfy your vigilante nature, think of it this way: If they are cheating, toxic, or any other blizzard ""offense"", by the sheer amount of players that player encounters while playing if he is doing something wrong, he will get punished in due time."

185,https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20754915335,What Hero Would You Create?,NA,"I honestly don't know.  I made up so many classes but here's one that counters anti-flankers by having an ability that can pass through walls.  It's a personal skill and I thought about the ult giving her team wall pass through but it might be too OP.  If we look at maps like Hanamura, Eichenwalde, Anubis, Ilios, and Volksaya on top of heroes like Mei, Junkrat, Symmetra, and Torbjorn who can lock an entire lane by themselves.  Symmetra can load up a lane with turrets while Mei or Junkrat can spam down the other lane and choke and the problem here is it forces the attacking side to go through a bottleneck without much dodging space.  Sure Winston, D.Va, and Pharah can jump over but let's be real how often do people actually rush over the choke?  So this class is created out of a fundamental need.  I'm also working on a tank that would punch permanent customizeable lanes.  Due to being permanent there'd be a set amount of meters he could bore through during the entire match.  Symmetra would likely rig the new lane's exit so that would open up one of the original lanes for flankers anyway.   I included the backstory explaining the technology behind her.  I wanted them sufficiently advanced enough to barely pass for ""supernatural"".  Since she can fly and is hitscan (left click only, much less damage than Soldier) she can also dogfight with Pharah.  Just don't bring up Paladins they don't have a class that can get through walls and they don't even need one since flanks are numerous and wider generally and with far fewer mainway chokes.  Here's the art all the images tie in and the focus of the post is the pink fairy omnic. The big circle is the outside of the floating omnium where she's from and would be a PvE stage. http://imgur.com/a/6vNzeHeight: 4’6” Health: 125 with 65 sheilds and 60 normal health. Her tiny hitbox makes this low health balanced. Backstory: The flying omnium was created by a corrupted AI who was originally built to fight against omnics, but due to his superior mind was able to forge pico bots which are like nanobots but smaller and create his own faction that’s opposed to both humans and the current omnics (the current omnics are defeated by the time the flying omnium becomes relevant in my alternative universe). Swarms of factory type pico bots form a fine cyan mist so it appears that these omnics come out of nowhere. They gather resources on Earth to bring back to the omnium and break them down at an atomic level to rebuild them into picobots, which are smaller than human cells and are like the cells of these new omnics, who seem more like half energy half metal based lifeforms instead of actual robots for that reason. However, one omnic that was constructed inherited the original creator’s intentions and gained awareness that they are doing wrong. She was ambushed by humans but boomerang girl saved her life. Now they protect the city together and are on the flying omnium’s hit list. Left shift: phase shift-her picobots spread giving her the ability to pass through walls. 14 second cool down, makes her hurtbox bigger but translucent while keeping the soft glow.  Totally immune to traps and constructions in this state and can still attack.  E: Launch- She simply launches into the air and glides but falls slightly faster than Mercy and has no rocket fuel. Launching close to nearby allies heals them for 100 health. Left click: hitscan lasers. Handles similar to Soldier’s gun but is drastically weaker. A wand that shoots lasers. Right click: charges laser. This projectile based laser attack destroys projectiles, traps, and does small AoE damage (bonus damage to constructions) and healing.Ult: Since she’s meant to counter anti flankers something along those lines without copying Sombra’s ult. She's a new kind of omnic that's much needed as she overcomes some of the game's flawed map design. Sym sets up turrets on a flank, Junkrat watches another, so now they're basically forced to go through a 10 foot wide door where getting hit with 6 people's spam is highly probable, so she'd help make one of the lanes safe for Genji and have a skill herself to pass through walls."

Can also be helpful in dealing with a Pharah with his primary weapon.Health Pool: Standard 200 HPWeapon: A lever-action rifle with a two shot kill range of roughly 20 meters, but then an inifinte three shot kill range afterwards with a moderate fire rate. Holds 10 rounds per mag. Hitscan.Secondary Weapon: Swaps to a shank, this allows Raptor to run at roughly the speed of Soldier's sprint and melee faster dealing 40 damage. Mainly intended as a means of moving faster.Passive: Awareness: All enemy builables and traps can be seen through walls if you are within 10 meters of them for a brief period or if you or a teammate spots it directly. These stay marked until the buildable is either destroyed, triggered, or relocated.Ability 1: Decoy: Sends out a small drone which projects an identical decoy which will move around and mimic fire, dealing and taking no damage for 5 seconds. Can draw enemy turret fire. 6 Second CD starts once the decoy goes down.Ability 2: Marked: Callout a single enemy target, marking them with a chevron listing the hero name and an outline that is visible through walls. CD starts as soon as the abililty is used and lasts as long as the ability, duration and CD still undecided.Ult: (No name as of yet) Raptor loads in a magazine of six high power rounds, dealing 300 damage, but the shots are now projectile with a slower fire rate. Lasts until all rounds are fired or player reloads. If you reload without firing a shot then you'll have 50% ult charge refunded. Callout for Enemies/Self: ""This'll put ya' down!"" Callout for Allies: ""You'd best start runnin""Legenday Skin Ideas:Anzac: Inspired by the Australian WW1 soldiers, weilding a more standard looking rifle and knife. Really thought of this one because of Frederick Bishop in BF1, turnt up rim of the hat to boot. Additional Respawn line: ""I'm an aussie, we're impossible to kill.""Primal: As the name implies, this outfit carries a very primal look, sporting animal furs with a bear tooth worn around the neck. Rifle now made of wood and stone primarly with fur covering parts as well. The knife's blade now an animal claw.Achievement Ideas:That's Not A Knife (Pixel): Score three killing blows with the shank equipped in a single life.Happy Hunting (Cute): Get four eliminations with the ultimate."

190,https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20754915335,What Hero Would You Create?,NA,"Name: Fritz Real Name: Azimov Prototype 53 Nationality: Believed to have been created in a defunct Omnium affiliated Lab long ago in England. Age: ??? Role: DefenseStory: Azimov Prototype 53 was really the first of its kind, having been created with seemingly some sort of consciousness, though perhaps this was more ingenious programming work. He was the last prototype created. Azimovs were created to be a peace-keeping unit for every household, designed to detain any intruders without harming them severely and altering authorities of intruders. This one served a dual purpose however, in also being a caretaker of the young son of the rich, polite couple that owned him. His defensive purpose made him an exceptional caretaker.Unfortunately there had been some sort of malfunction with most other earlier units causing them to become rather hostile. Production was shut down and they were all recalled to be destroyed and sold for scrap. Amazingly enough Azimov had avoided detection by disappearing into the sewers of London where he has lived for many, many years avoiding people and the wars that have taken place. Though all the time down there can lead to unfortunate circumstances. Not only has his mind become addled, many body parts are starting to fall apart.Recently he left the underground bunker of his home in search of a new purpose as he has lost a lot of his memories. His data has become rather corrupted, therefore giving him the nick-name of Fritz. I imagine him as a senile, friendly robot.Appearance: Rusted, archaic, past technology. His left leg and right arm have been replaced with scrapped metal he found around the sewers. Still wears his old top-hat, though it certainly has seen better days. He's got an open hole in his chest where his rats have built a nest to live inside him for protection.Abilities:Handgun: A 3-shot burst laser pistol given to Fritz by the family that owned him for self defense when he ran away to hide.Alarm Unit: He can deploy a small alarm bot that will let off a loud siren should anyone get nearby where it has been placed. It alerts other players to the location as well as lets off a small stun on the player(s) caught in its grasp. (So mini Infra-sight+Stun)Rat-pack: He can summon a small army of rats to attack people for a limited time. The rats, however, will seek out Turrets, Portals, Mines, Traps and kill them first before attacking people.Ultimate: Haywire- Sends out electrical waves from the hero for X Seconds, damaging and slowing all nearby enemy heroes.A few Voice Line Interactions:Fritz: ""Hey there short one, you look pretty good firing those bullets."" Tbjorjorn: ""What?"" Fritz: ""I wasn't talking to you, I was talking to gal beside you."" (I.E, the turret. He hits on the turret. I thought that would be rather amusing.Zenyatta: ""An azimov prototype? I'm amazed one of you survived so long."" Fritz: ""Aza-mawhatsit now? I have no idea what you're talking about floating fellow."" Zenyatta: ""Well, mostly survived.""Fritz: ""Lucio your music is pretty interesting, but nothing beats Sinatra."" Lucio: ""Frank Sinatra? That's pretty old school man."" Fritz: ""No no, my pet rat. He serenades me every night."" Lucio: ""Uh..sure thing.""Fritz: ""Bastion, come here can give your old uncle a hug!"" Bastion: ""Boo dee doo doo!"" Fritz: ""What do you mean I'm not your uncle!?""Bastion: ""Boo doo doo bee doop."" Fritz: *Laughs* ""Bastion, you tell the best jokes.""McRee: ""It's High Noon.""

Head of a group of bioingeneers, Warbeck studied the functionality of the human mind, and designed various patters of behaviour for his A.I. Using his cerebral implants, he created a perfect replica of his mind, and then programmed it to strategize for defense. Thus, Argus was born. The very first God Program. Argus, was meant to be the replacement of the English Nacional Security, but he went rogue, rebelling against his creator. It tried to merge his Mindcode with Warbeck's body, taking control of his cerebral implants, to create a perfect being, a human machine. But things didn't go as Argus planned. The assault left Warbeck in a state of crazed paranoia, with partial control over his own body, and very little memory of who he was before. He took the identity of Argus and left England, seeking aid. He asked the Cientist Council in Oasis for help, and in exchange he promised to oversee the Advanced Robotics Ministery. Nowadays he lives a recluse, a hermit in Oasis, crafting the worlds most advanced defense systems and dealing with his life as a dual entity.Abilities:Passive: Overshield.

Damage varies according to charge amount.Shield Drone (Right Click): Targets an ally hero and deploys a drone that grants Overshield, blocking all incoming damage for 3s. More that one drone can be active at a time, on different heroes. Drones last until destroyed. If the Overshield is destroyed, it will regenerate after 20s, providing the drone is still active.Cybershroud (Left Shift): Enters a shroud of electrical energy that grants him movement speed and does little damage to enemies around himRecon Droid (E ability): Summons a droid that guards a determinate area.

Role select is honestly not good. Role select will increase queue times, which are already very bad for Masters+ players. Role select will also make it annoying for people who like to flex and it will generally frustrate people.

Every single match I've played today, be it in the Game Browser, Arcade, or Quick Play, I've watched my entire team select everything but a tank or healer.  Oh, you might get the occasional D.va or Winston for tanks, but it's kinda pointless without a healer, especially when they're playing a very aggressive, ""Ain't Care"" style of play.The game really needs some kind of Role Select, even if it increases queue times.  I love sitting there for five to ten minutes waiting for a match, only to have no healer.  I 'main' a Mercy, but without a dedicated group, it can be frustrating to play with a bunch of rando's who really don't care about anything.  So I like to play different characters and work on my skills with a few of them (ideally I'd like to be proficient with at least one character from every role).But the last thing I want to do is heal a bunch of childish people who refuse to play as a team and work together.  It doesn't matter what mode you're playing in, it's still a team game, you still work together, and you still try to win.I think perhaps a role select at the top of the main menu screen where you could choose a Primary and Secondary role before being able to queue up for anything would be rather nice.  It'd let me pick, say, Support and Defense, or Support and Fill.  Something along those lines, perhaps in a similar vein to League of Legends.  Is this a perfect solution?  Probably not.  But something needs to be done about the selfish people ruining the match because supports and tanks are looked at as ""boring"" for some reason.

The best thing I found is to just match my language to the kinds of words they are using, but it doesn't always work. I think its more often the case that when I do try to communicate that I have people willing to listen or help, or just be completely ignored because no one is in teamchat, but there are still many cases in which people are being really rude to me bacause I'm a girl. I just get so used to it in games that for the most part I ignore it, but this time it was just really frustrating.

He should mostly be in recon mode, and only go into turret mode in certain specific situations (taking down shields and melting tanks, basically).  In other words, he now usually functions as a poor-man's Soldier (similar primary fire, but no helix rocket, a heal that prevents him from shooting, and a much larger hit box that is not fully compensated for by 100 extra armor), who also has the additional ability to melt shields and tanks better than Soldier can."

It's like comparing a heap of garbage to just a regular bag of garbage.Old Bastion had no survivability and no use. Recon mode was awful and sentry mode was also awful. Bastion never had a chance to heal because they would die too quickly before finding a spot to heal. The only thing objectively better about Bastion was their ultimate and their capability to kill close-ranged DPS.Current Bastion can actually attempt escapes now with faster transformations and healing on the go. Recon mode doesn't feel like Soldier 76 in a wheelchair and turret form is still capable of tearing through tanks and destroying barriers. Their ultimate is slightly worse, but it was already pretty bad to begin with. Effectively I feel like it's still in the same place because the slight change to their healthpool doesn't really mean anything in the grand scheme of things; Bastion is still going to instantly die the second one stun hits them and everyone looks at them.By far, current Bastion is on the right track. They just still need actual buffs and the dev team need to let Bastion actually try to stand on their two feet for awhile. I cannot to this day understand why they would nerf Bastion two days after launch so significantly.

Please Watchhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kDqZ_dsZAQ________Recently purchased a amazing new Ultrawide monitor however I've since learned that Overwatch does not support true 21:9 aspect ratio and instead crops the game to fit which actually ends up showing less than normal 16:9. Apparently Blizzard says it would be unfair and thus has implemented this janky version instead. Why are you crippling Ultrawide users by showing them less than 16:9 I'm baffled. I'm here to beg Blizzard to please reconsider. The real argument at hand here is if Blizzard is concerned about competitive play then why is no one discussing the other things that also give advantages like console users being able to play with mouse and keyboard or people with better internet giving them lower latency or monitor refresh rates giving better accuracy and smoothness. Why is that the people who have decided to upgrade their hardware to Ultrawides must chose whether or not to play with black bars or this severely cropped version. I find it rather baffling that every major title that has been release in the last 10 years has support for true 21:9 resolutions including other competitive shooters and mobas like CS:GO or HOTS yet somehow it's not okay in Overwatch. What makes Overwatch different from other competitive shooters that 21:9 is not okay here but okay everywhere else? What about Destiny 2 that just came out, I've been playing it and it looks amazing because it supports the real aspect ratio and is not cropped; even the pre-rendered cutscenes are in true 21:9 which I commend Bungie for because even games like Witcher3 give black boarders during cutscenes. The reality is that casuals players like myself simply just want to play the game and have fun and basically telling us that our hardware is unfair is silly. We aren't going to competitive offline tournaments where 16:9 is the standard so what is the big deal here? No one wants to play with black bars on their screen when every other game in the world including all other competitive shooters support real 21:9. Forget CS:GO, what about Gears, CoD, BattleField, Destiny2 all competitive shooters supporting 21:9. Overwatch is a freaking casual game, just let people enjoy themselves. Like others have pointed out in this thread how often would any of you people against 21:9 even run into players like me with Ultrawides when only 1% users even own one.Can we please get an update on this or will Blizz stay forever silent on this issue?"

This is what needs to be adjusted.Jumping delays it and most heroes have the abilities to escape it.(See a few post above this.)I'm not saying that enemies shouldn't be able to escape it, but Mei should at least have the upper hand in a close battle, because she can't attack multiple enemies at once nor can't she attack enemies from far away.Make her primary fire a hitscan, give her primary fire a larger spread, allow her to freeze multiple enemies at once or make her freeze enemies faster, even with her ult.Just one of these suggestions would be enough to make her slightly more viable.She's a tank/DPS hybrid. Her purpose is to stall points and act as an anti-flanker/anti-mobility. Right now is she only good for stalling points.If Mercy got reworked because hiding and rezzing wasn't fun, Dva got reworked because she was a DM bot, Roadhog got changed because his OHK wasn't fun, then why is Mei, who is primarily used for stalling, fine?

It's used more to prevent enemies to get on the objective.When you get killed, stunned, hooked or sleep-darted, now the ultimate doesn't refundMinor problems:Icicles:They are the only projectiles affected by damage decayThe minimum damage they can do is 22 (because of the damage decay), and compared to other heroes, this is not really muchIce wall:Allies can't see where are you going to place the wall, and this can make them frustrated easily, and this favors the trolling(These are some ways proposed by me and other players to make her more viable)Buff suggestions:Frost stream:Now it decreases the effect of ""special movement"" abilities (like double jumps, run, and similar abilities), initial debuff effect from 10% that increases up to 25%Now affects vertical movements tooFrozen shields will take (20%) more damageSpeed has been increased to 30 m/sThis adjustment will make her primary mechanic more effective, punishes players that tries to engage Mei closely and makes her able to give teammates an occasion to destroy a shield.Cryofreeze:Now automatically reloads her weapon similar to Wraith FormAna and Moira's orbs now can heal Mei in cryofreezeNow Mei will be ready to fight again, and will be able to be healed by other healers. Blizzard:When you are killed, stunned, sleep-darted or hooked, Snowball (the drone) continues to go as a grenade and get activatedIt decreases enemies's movement abilities effect as the primary fire, but up to 45% this timeThe cast time should be reduced/removed. Mei can lose the ultimate when the drone is in her hand and not while it's out of her hand and it's going to landNow the ultimate can be used as an area denial and crowd control tool. It will punish poor enemy positioning more often, and will reward players that can escapeIciclesThe damage falloff should be reduced (minimum range or damage increased)Ice wallNow allied can see the aura of where the wall will be spawned (proposed by XodiaK)It's slippery for enemies: if a Genji tries to climb it, a Widowmaker tries to grapple or a Lucio tries to wallride on it, they will fall. This will make rage less the teammates because they will know where the wall will be (useful also for players without a microphone). Probably this will discourage the trolling. Also will make it a better defense tool.Netcode/latenciesWhen Mei enters in cryofreeze it actives without the possibility to be hooked/stunned/killed and she starts to heal herselfWhen the wall spawns bullets can't trepass itThis will make Mei more viable and less frustrating to play, with these issues fixed and with a better netcodeBug and issues:Check the Reddit threads i linked, there are listed all Mei bugs with proofsTL;DRMei at the moment she's inefficient compared to other heroesShe needs bug fixes,QoL fixes/adjustments and few buffsA lot of heroes can escape her freeze ray and her ultimate.She got a lot of unfixed bugs(Sorry for the wall of text.)"

Fixing her known bugs, which cripple her playstyle.2) Frost stream: make her left-click hitscan, and delete the total freeze effect. Replace it with a bigger slow effect (that lingers for a bit) and disables movement abilities after 0.8 sec (to give them time to get out if they react fast enough). This gives her a true role of anti-flanker. A bit of extra damage would be appreciated as well.3) increase the minimum damage on her right click (max range) to 35/40.4) Ice wall: add an extra pillar for more versatility. Add an indicator for the allied teamembers as well.5) cryo-freeze: cut the time in the ice-block to 3 sec, and increase her healing accordingly. Make her reload her gun over time in cryo-freeze.6) Blizzard: make the thrown ultimate act like a grenade and activate regardless of mei's life. Make the ult freeze a tad faster as well. It's too escapable right now."

I would like to write to you today to discuss the current state of Junkrat's ability commonly referred to as ""RIP-Tire."" This ability is regarded as one of the most unbalanced and not fun abilities to play against. There are several reasons for this. One being that the tire moves incredibily quickly and can turn on a dime. This makes it basically luck to hit with projectiles and extremely hard to hit with hitscan, even among the top level. Also, junkrat builds his tire extremely quickly, which is not good for an ability which is considered overpowered or good. For example, Zarya's ultimate ability known as ""Graviton Surge,"" builds slowly because of how powerful it is. Lastly, an issue not brought up often but is very important in my personal opinion is that tire can ride along roofs. This is very broken because the tire can LOS(Line of Sight) the players and gives it plenty of cover. In addition, when it rides along the roof, it is silent and you do not hear the engine of the tire like you would when it is riding along the ground.

More than anything it's to shed light on the issues that Symmetra is facing and how she's becoming obsolete with the evolving nature of the game. These ideas are the kind of ideas Symmetra players wonder about when they think of ""viability"" in the sense that other characters have that fall under the category of support, without boxing her into something as arbitrary as a healer. I've tried to limit the amount of ""reworking"" suggestions in this thread, but at this point, I'm leaning more towards it due to her place in the evolving nature of the game and competitive team comps. If you have an idea you feel is within her playstyle and will bring her viability, please list it in this forum. Ideas that have been thrown out:(Kyleesie Ideas)New Features to Existing Abilities:Photon BarrierChange the shape of the barrier into a sphere so it can block damage from all angles, and fully protect someone running with it.Health readuced to 900 down from 1025.- OR -Provides 75 shields to any ally it comes into contact with. The shields decay slowly 3 seconds after leaving a 5 meter radius of the Turret projecting the barrierReddit Idea:Let her place supportive turrets.(The issue with this is it’s not as flexible as other support utility and is too area based. Which in the end would cause the same potential problems as before)My idea:Her Glove as a Secondary weapon, similar to torb and mercy, unlocks a new ability under the primary fire of this ""weapon"": Photon Shield (yes, bring it back)Channeled ability, resource meter of 12-15 seconds. 30 Yard range. Grants 40 barrier health to your target per second. Can give up to 50 extra health. When not channeling, will degenerate at a rate of 5 hp per second. Barrier health is the same mechanic used in sound barrier and doomfists passive, which is why I suggest using this mechanic as a ""psuedo-heal"". This would grant her a place in the game as the only support counter available to Ana's grenade. She'll still primary play as a defensive dps, but this will give her defensive support utility that helps sustain the team and the main healer, without actually making her a healer. The way that barrier health functions, it would work somewhere between healing and the original photon shield. That is, that instead of providing a flat hp bonus, it would give a max of 50 ""bonus health"", but since it's barrier health, any missing HP would have to be filled with Symmetra's resource meter degenerating barrier health (like doomfist) before the ""bonus"" hp would apply.These suggestions, or variations of it, are the most popular on the forums. I’d even be willing to have her gun range nerfed, as lower SR seems to hate it, in exchange for more utility.Basically the same as her old ability, but not a flat hp bonus. Since it’s barrier health, missing hp has to be given before giving the bonus.Lastly, this is a quote that I really like from one of the other very well thought out Symmetra threads (Kyleesie's thread) that I really enjoyed.  This basically sums up opinion on why on why it may be necessary to give her a ""pseudo-heal""/stronger damage mitigation, while staying true to the developers vision for her. You don't need to make her a healer! That's the beauty of it. You just need to make her sustain to the point the team doesn't miss an offhealer :)Comments: I know the developers intentionally designed Sym without any traditional healing. However, while I respect their philosophy to design a unique way for her to function as a support, I strongly feel that her inability to heal (especially while classified as a ""support"" hero) negatively affects how players perceive her in the game. Simply put, Symmetra confuses people. New players are unsure of what she is used for, and veteran competitive and pro players don't value her utility over other support heroes who can actually heal. As a result, Symmetra is stifled by negative opinions, and those who choose to play her receive an egregious and unfair amount of toxicity and blame.Ideas added later based on discussions within the thread:Mohock Ideas: Letting her be stronger anti-mobility by having turrets affect things such as Dash/Blink, allowing her to set the base of her ultimate in a predetermined location before she gets it.Crestren Ideas: Allowing her to have more buildables, such as bridges, elevators, or structures that grant support to the team.Dr.Fate Idea:: Symmetra is granted a passive that gives sustain, similar to Lucio but exclusively affecting shield HP pools."
536,https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759380928,[MEGATHREAD-UNCAPPED] Symmetras place in the game,NA,"Here are some of my potential ideas that could improve her kit and make her more viable:Turret-Survivability:Give her turrets thermoptic camo like Sombras. The turret stays invisible until an enemy comes in reach, decloaks and shoots. After a few seconds out of combat they recloak again. This would allow for more flexible and creative traps and prevents Tracer/DVa/Reaper from shootgunsniping them across the map.Turret-Placement: Give her turrets the flying behavior like the shieldcore, but instead of getting destroyed by hitting a surface, the turret sticks to it. This would solve the immobility issue while placing them, they could be used to contest high ground more effective and they would be more viable to push a point. Bonus buff if they would start fireing midflight.Turret-Slowing: Slowing effects from the turrets (or Mei) could be applied to ""teleport""-abilities like Tracers Blink or Genjis Dash, resulting in a shortening of the traveling distance equivalent of the percentage the hero is slowed down. A 25% Movement speed reduction from one turret would lead to a 10,5m dash instead of 14m.Ultimates: Let her place the base plate of her ultimates in advance even with 0% on her ultcharge and activate them when they are ready. You would set up the base with Q and could change the placement at any time by building a new one in case you change your mind or they get destroyed. I would even disable their shields until they are activated so flankers could dispose of them quickly if discovered. Pressing Q with 100% ultcharge would bring up the same image as of now of the sg/tp and you can select to activate the existing base by looking up or build a new one by looking down towards the ground. This way, Symmetra players don't have to leave the battle for prolonged times to set up her ults at a good spot and they can be activated right as the fight breaks loose to get a better impact."

People like that cant even climb to plat with her.Sym was strong because there wasn't many strong heroes back there but with recent buffs to other heroes and new heroes coming out, her kit become too weak because whenever a new patch note come out, she is passively nerfed one way or another.Even Luminum has been screaming about buffing her. Aside from Luminum, Hoshi and Stevo, no one would be able to reach their level especially Luminum as his skilled plays are incredible with limited kit. But the level of blocking all the Tracer and Rein's ult, even using turrets to block Doomfist's Rocket Punch is extremely high, if you dont main her to at least Diamond, its impossible to do it.Recently, Moira is out and with her mobility, she can outplay Sym with ease. Believe me or not, Sym will start to fall back along with Torb (really, these two dont need to have their skin designed in WC, no one gonna pick them)Sometimes i feel i could have been in Master by spending 150 hours on another char instead of sym but i love her and seeing her at the bottom of the game and being hated by most of the community is really sad."

If something like this does get implemented then Symm would hopefully receive balance tweaks to make her viable without being OP.---Secondary weapon: Hard Light ConstructorPrimary fire launches an orb-like object in a straight line that sticks to the first surface it hits. Up to two of these orbs can exist at once. Like her turrets, orbs have a cooldown but can store several charges.If both orbs are placed within line of sight of each other, a hard light structure is created between them. The type of structure depends on whether the orbs are on floors/ceilings/walls.Illustration of different structure types: https://i.imgur.com/ygMBfDT.pngDetails of different structure types:Bridges stay in place, allowing allies to walk over themElevators move between both orbs, carrying any allies standing on themAllies standing above/under a Power Field gain increased damage (and/or rate of fire?)Allies who walk through a Boost Screen gain a temporary movement speed boost (and/or a temporary shield?)Secondary fire deactivates active orbs/structures.The orbs can be destroyed but have regenerating shields to protect themselves like Symm's teleporter/shield generator.I personally like it as it does fit in Sym's character. It also helps alleviate mobility to non mobile heroes (like Ana, Zen, Mei) so she can play a role in that and help her team move around better. And it does fit as it provides another utility to help support her team as shes not a healer type, she supports her team with her utility."
540,https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759380928,[MEGATHREAD-UNCAPPED] Symmetras place in the game,NA,"I've played Sym for over 200 hours and she's carried me from about 1700 to about 60 points away from Diamond. One suggestion I've had for a while is to add a simple 1HP barrier to her turrets, as a barrier will always absorb the impact from blow no matter how much it does. This would prevent them from being destroyed by something like D.Va's ult, Rein charge, Genji's Swift Strike, Lucio's Boop, Junkrat's Concussion Mine, etc. It gives Symmetra more staying power because there are less ways to counter her turrets, which are her main mode of support, but they still only effectively have 2HP so any automatic weapon fire can still dispose of them quickly.Another is that Symmetra just needs to take less time to do things across the board. She takes too long to deploy turrets, which then also have to activate so around 2 seconds from deployment to activation time for a turret which makes her harder to use on attack since she needs so much setup time. Her photon barrier needs to deploy earlier in the animation and closer to Symmetra, there are so many times where I have perfectly timed a block only to have the Hook/Flashbang/Widow Headshot go through it and then the barrier floats away from my corpse.I also think an interesting buff would be to either have her alt fire charge faster or move faster. She has the only basic attack that goes through barriers at range and, while useful in its current state, can sum up to poke damage if they have two healers. I think allowing it to either move or charge faster would give Symmetra a better chance on attack as she would be able to deal massive, unforgiving amounts of damage to the enemy team. These are mostly just QoL suggestions, as far as I'm concerned. The only straight buff is the charge or movement speed, and I think that's pretty minor tbh. The only serious kit alteration I could think would be to re-add back the photon shield at 25 and let her stack that with her shield generator, with the caveat that the 25 shields disappear if she dies. That would allow Symmetra to have a somewhat better impact before she's able to get an ultimate up, but can be punished if she were to die."

My issue with Symmetra is that her supportive potential is near non-existent if your team has no awareness. I included some of Luminums gameplay in my post to illustrate this. He was doing a phenomenal job attempting to support his team, but they weren't taking his openings and not letting him support. In turn, it was like he didn't do anything, even though he was working extra hard with his limited kit.Imagine if an entire character's kit was similar to Zarya's grav in the sense that it needs friendly follow up to actually do anything?

If she's melting low SR due to her gun, it's probably a good idea not to increase her killing potential (which is honestly fine). A sphere photon shield does little to support her kills with the low range of her gun, while it does help her team move forward.

There's not really a TLDR, but if you want to get the gist of it, skim through the bolded areas.Hi Guys. I’ve been hesitant to post this thread, and instead wanted to wait until after Blizzcon to do so. There’s been a huge surge of concern over Symmetra’s place in the game, so much so that there are 3 Megathreads (all from people in masters, with obvious game sense) on making her more supportive in the general forum, and a reddit thread with 3000+ upvotes. https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759249296?page=1https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20758668065?page=1https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759257002?page=1https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759220930?page=1https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/7afy3b/the_change_for_symmetra_we_didnt_know_we_needed/?utm_term=b41127a9-d761-42ca-93eb-d750b12c3337&amp;utm_medium=search&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=Overwatch&amp;utm_content=1After hearing the recent Q&amp;A regarding Symmetra, it’s kind of clear that the developers are somewhat unsure of her place in the game, and so I’m hoping that this thread will concisely summarize her issues as well as give the developers clear knowledge of how to fix her, rather than recategorizing her. Blizzcon Q&amp;A:Any plans to make Symmetra more viable in competitive? Maybe healing abilities?Symmetra doesn't really fit well in the support category, but doesn't fit in defense either. In the future we might need to revist the categories to better accomodate changes with the game.Symmetra doesn't see much play in high competitive, but her recent toolkit change brought some interesting changes that made her more viable.Please, please, developers. It’s obvious you listen to us, otherwise a Talon Healer wouldn’t have been the next hero despite the massive demand for her. The community obviously wants her to be more supportive. Recategorizing her will not fix her fundamental issues when there are currently better, more intuitive options in the game for her niche (junkrat), as well as more supportive options for her niche coming as well (moira).From the Patch concerning her rework:""We wanted to address two main issues with Symmetra. First, on the whole, we felt that she didn’t feel active enough. Second, due to the nature of her Teleporter, she felt weak in certain situations on different maps and game modesTo address the first point, we replaced her more passive Photon Shield ability with a much more active ability: Photon Barrier. Now, Symmetra can help lead the charge on offense or help shut down a big push on defense by actively blocking damage for your team. For the second point, we noticed players would often switch off of Symmetra once they found themselves in a situation where her Teleporter wasn’t as useful. For example, when playing her on defense on an Assault map, players often used her to defend the first capture point, then quickly switched to another hero if that point fell. To help her feel more useful in more situations, we've given her an alternative to her Teleporter. The Shield Generator is just as important for the enemy to deal with, but is useful in more situations. .""This is important to note, as she is the most passive support out of all 5, and she is also the most situational. She is not viable on attack, as the intention of the rework. The first rework failed its intended purpose.You can read through this or skim to the bolded sections. While a lot of people argue that Symmetra is strong within her niche. That is precisely the issue with her. When she was most viable was within her Niche on chokes such as Hanamura, Eichenwalde, and Volksaya defense. There were numerous complaints on how hard chokes were to break through, so developers made several balancing adjustments, both to the maps, and characters who had either abilities or mobility to deal with the chokes. From that point onwards,  new map development gave a lot of alternative pathways and elevation that lessened her Niche's effectiveness and gave numerous easy options for counterplay, not to mention she’s not very viable outside of her niche, either.The point? The newest maps, newest characters, and newest buffs to heroes mean that her original Niche is shrinking, and her viability outside that niche is dismal if not compromising to the team. AKA: She’s not relevant to the current version of the game.The elephant in the room: She is the utility support, however, she is the only support whose utility mechanics are not readily available for use (speed, discord, damage boost) while the other support who has utility on cooldown has two highly active, flexible utility abilities that have a variety of uses that outclass Photon Barrier, and have less counters than her turrets do.  The other issue is that all of these support alternatives not only have better utility in their actual kit (not taking into account ultimates), but all the other support utility is in conjunction to healing. She was designed as a damage mitigating, utility support, that defends the backlines; however, almost all of the support in her kit comes from her ultimate, which makes her the only character who is balanced entirely around the merit of her ultimate- which is one of her design flaws, if this patch from Blizzard is any indication:Game-changing ultimate abilities were coming up a bit too frequently. This change helps keep them in check while still allowing them to be powerful. (universal nerf to ultimate charge)If a character is balanced around an ultimate, then it is likely that their kit is lacking. Symmetra has the lowest ultimate costs in the game, and can keep her ultimate up indefinitely. This should raise concerns as to what part of her kit makes this necessary in her design. They wanted her to more engaging in the rework, with more of a capacity for proactive and reactive engagement, but her kit has most of the most passive abilities in the game. Also important to note, if all of her her supportive merit is funneled into her destructible ultimates, she will always lose to Zen/Lucio, who don’t need their ultimate or to keep a structure alive to be supportive. Not only that, but her supportive capacity was originally her E, which rightly means that her original design did not involve a passive ultimate to provide support.Please, complete her kit. We know this is something you’re capable of doing. Within the last month, you completed Mercy’s kit due to the feedback of DPS mains. This is feedback from the people who play the character. Please fix her.She doesn’t  NEED  to heal, but she suffers from an incomplete kit as a support character. (if you need proof she's a support) Luminums videos show her potential as a support, but watching his videos often makes it clear to me that her kit is just not as cohesive as the other characters in the game, even the defense characters which skeptics seem to be convinced she is. His best plays are supportive plays, so she obviously has potential as a support. She just plays more like an offensive support, similar to Zen.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1GvmBQk8-shttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flWwBFCTjsUhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBbe7ylCy18(this was patched but shows how he needs high game sense, and to be innovative to a crazy level to succeed with her limited kit) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sJwuH1BMwY(this video shows the potential of team flanks at 4:10) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YhsywtY2OM(and this video shows why symmetra falls short as a support… she needs her team to support her for her to support them. She’s more follow-through dependent than any other support because she lacks support in her actual kit, but people will troll you because they see you as a “troll pick”) He makes great plays, saving his team from reinhardt ultimates, making team flanks, etc. But really, while that’s amazing, there’s not much he can do inbetween that except try to make picks. While other offsupports like lucio/zen, have their utility up (speed/discord) in addition to no cooldown, no ultimate options for heals (heal aura/harmony orb).Quality of Life adjustments for Symmetra are necessary, but if that is all she receives, she likely won't have a place in the game as the game evolves.The best, and most commonly suggested Quality of Life suggestions are:Turrets: Reduce the delay in placing and ""activating"" the turrets after you deploy them, as well as remove the slow that Symmetra is afflicted with when placing them.Ultimates: Let them be seen through walls for teammates, as well as willful deconstruction of her barrier generator so a skilled Symmetra can change her nesting location, similarly to how a widowmaker will change her sniping location. Let her deconstruct her teleporter to redeem some of her ult charge if the charges are running low. Also, allow her to build her ultimates on walls and ceilings at slightly longer range, so her setups become less predictable.(via AConstelle) Remove the 5-6 second delay she has on gaining ult when her Shield Generator is destroyed. The delay isn't there for TP, but it is for Shield Gen for some reason, and 6 seconds is a lot of time for Sym. Also the blue line indicating the Shield Gen's radius would be swell.Photon Barrier: There have been numerous suggestions for this ability. Increase the charges on it, decrease the cooldown, give her more control over it. The biggest consistent complaint I've seen with this ability is the fact that Symmetra has a harder time contributing with this support utility than other supports have contributing with their utility that is often on a lower cooldown or does not have a cooldown while simultaneously being easier skills to contribute with. This ability needs to be able to compete with an offhealing slot, period. It’s her only active support ability. The other point I want to bring up is that she is the only support who has a viable alternative to rez, which a lot of people are concerned about.[Moderator edit - I removed the direct call-out to the Dev team.  The Feedback here is greatly appreciated but the idea of the forums is a discussion among players.  The Dev team has access to the discussion and may take part in the discussion but the main focus is the discussion.  Not shutting this down just trying to redirect the focus :) ]"

This leaves them a ton of room for creativity in regards to giving her something fresh and in her playstyle.They had Lucio, zen, Ana, and mercy healing and they still made Moira which feels distinct and unique.

Considering how long we on Console have been effectively shafted though, this was the best option I could think of.[Warning: Wall of text incoming.]If it was planned, from day one, to release the game on both PC and Console, then why are the concerns of the Console player base not being addressed, or at the very least, acknowledged? We had no choice but to buy the game for $60 (we didn't have an option of being able to buy the game for just $40 like PC does). This means that we are having to spend more just to be able to even get the game to begin with.Furthermore, we not only had to wait 15 months for a report system, but said system is super abusable. If you guys on PC think that the report system and automated bans is rough, allow me to enlighten you: it's even WORSE on Console. If we file a ticket with Blizzard as a result of a ban in-game on Console, we will be told that the Consoles have separate systems that Blizzard can't access, and will thus be told to file a ticket with Microsoft/Sony. If we file a ticket with Microsoft/Sony, they state that they don't handle in-game bans, only gamer-tag bans. This means that neither party knows anything with regards to Console in-game bans. Why are we being told to file a ticket with Microsoft or Sony, even though they've already stated that they do NOT handle in-game bans?

Competitive for us on Console really does not mean jack simply because there is no end-game. There's no OWL, Contenders, Open Division, heck; there's not even a single tournament that we on Console can even get that's hosted, much less sponsored, by Blizzard. Before anyone mentions it, yes I get that Blizzard has always been more of a PC developer than a Console one. However, they released the game on all platforms, and even had planned to do so from the very beginning. Therefore, this same care that Blizzard gives to PC, needs to be given to Console as well. Say someone on our platform reaches Top 500 and really wants to play in things like Open Division; what would happen? Would that person be forced to move over to PC just to have a chance? Simple little standard things like this really press home the second class citizen vibe that we console players receive. With all this said, can we at least get an update on when our current issues will be addressed please? We don't want our player-base to fade away completely because our feedback is not being listened to. The game started out very strong with the platform support, but now it feels like it just got dropped. I'm simply asking that we actually GET the value of the money that we spent on the game.If you read all the way up to this point, then you have no idea how much I appreciate this, because it shows that you really do care.Just to reiterate this again: I do apologize if this is the wrong way to go about this.

It seems like a huge flaw that they couldn't work on the highlight saving feature because they had to implement reporting on console.  I've spent at minimum $50 per event and would like to know how my money is improving the console version of this game.  It seems pretty ridiculous that they spend all this time, effort and money creating 4 different PC E-leagues that they need to stop working on a highlight save feature just to add a reporting feature that already existed on PC to console.  Not to mention the other issues console deals with such as the linear ramp issues.I've held off buying loot boxes these last 3 events because I just don't see my money going to improve the console version.

With that time, maybe you can work to afford yourself some more video games?[Warning: Wall of text incoming.]Keep in mind: I didn't make this thread to hear PC Elitists mock us (I'm not looking at the 'hur dur PC Master Race' posts here (you know what I'm implying); I'm looking at those posts that relate to ""Buy a PC you Console Peasant/2nd class citizen"", etc.). I made this thread to let our voices with regards to our platform of the game be heard.Consoles have more convenience in them, and the vast majority of us have friends that play on Console, not on PC. We're not blind in this community. Look at threads that get a reply from devs in this forum (not to be confused with mods here). How many of those threads are PC related, and something small (i.e. when new cosmetics are coming)? Sure, it's not many, but it still has the better reply chance. Now look at the other end: the threads that are Console related, and something well researched/documented. How many of these kinds of threads get a reply from devs? Practically none.To answer your last bit: yes I already do have a job. The reason why I don't go and buy more games is because:1. It's made by a company who is known to have greedy business practices (I'm looking at you EA, main Activision (so as not to be confused with Blizzard Entertainment), and Ubisoft, to name a few). 2. Overwatch is still better than quite a lot of games that were made even this year (even despite what it lacks on Console). If I come off as somebody who sounds easily tilted, that may very much be the case (I won't deny it). However, not only did we still pay for the game, but a good chunk of the things that we've been wanting/needing, we've been asking since launch (that's almost 19 months ago now). We still are as passionate as you guys on PC are about this game. We aren't even asking for a lot with threads like this one, and Biv's (linked in OP), to name a couple. We don't even get something as simple as ""Hey guys, we hear you loud and clear!"" on these forums, even despite all of our concerns. Yet, there's threads that ask when new cosmetics are coming that get answered within a few hours, and in some cases, even as little as 15 minutes. Look at how long we had to wait for our Report System (and this is just to name one example). We didn't even get a reply about when our Report System would be coming until 8 months after the game launched (this was when they hoped to have it in during, or even before summer, you see). When we had asked for an update in July, we get the response of ""Soon™"" (again, you know what I'm implying). Now you have 14 months past launch and it's still not in the Console version of the game. The Report Feature was not enabled for us until the 1.14 patch, which released on August 28th. That's 15 months gone that we've had to deal with being unable to report glitchers, throwers, etc.. I'm not going to so much use the term cheaters in this bit; a vast majority of the cheating that had occurred on Console were people glitching into walls to be able to prevent point caps making it impossible for the attacking team to cap their objective. So we had people that could get away with literally anything and everything and we wouldn't be able to do anything about it.You also can't justify the excuse of ""It's because of Sony/Microsoft"" either. Games that have been available on Console have already had a Report System available on day 1. Heck, Fortnite is still in beta, and it already has a Report System. Hope I've cleared up some of our situation to you. Apologies if I've sounded critical on some parts. As I stated though, we are still passionate about this game just as much as you guys are.What are you not getting?!?I was not talking to you. My post was to someone else. I think i made that clear on my previous post. You just got offended because I gave someone a christmas solution and your butthurt about it.  since you dont want to switch and that is fine.

Rein deserves one for protecting his team from an ult storm with his shield; same with Orisa. Winston deserves one for a perfect bubble &amp; kill combo, or a nice killstreak with his ult.

We were on attack, just about to get the third point but it was going nowhere. I last minute switched to Pharah, got my ult pretty quickly, flanked and got a triple rocket barrage and a mid air kill on someone else which lead to us getting the point.

Lies.You're also biasing the PoTG system even further towards DPS with your multikill angle. It's an even dumber system than what we already have in place. I swear to god I saw many times Mercy randomly healing 2 people on the objective after a tean fight though they didn't lose so much of their hp. Also, I saw a Hanzo potg with no single hit or any damage done, but when it comes up to me sending a DVa bomb into the enemy team and killing four people, the potg is just a bastard torb killing 2 already weakended guys on my team. You also need to take in mind that the game's automatic systems are very !@#$ and broken so they allow a healing Mercy get potg instead of multikills."

Game requires bunny hoping.,NA,"Sorry to tell you but all of you are wrong and it's OP's mistake due to poor reasoning and writing. I'll explain you what's going on with this matter, why it is stupid to be implemented and what it is in first place.Bunny hop has nothing to do with a mere spam space. It was essentially a glitch in counter strike where the character's velocity was increasing if you were strafe jumping in certain patterns. Strafe jumping can be observed with soldier, while sprinting and lucio. However, if you were pressing space again in a specific momentum, your character wasn't losing his velocity, which had as a result to increase continuously your speed. As the speed increases, it becomes more difficult to control your momentum in both strafes and jumps, so eventually you fail. That was bunny hop.It was forbidden to be used in tournaments for long time, since it messed around with the engagement timings. In short there was a high distortion in time (you didn't know when an enemy 1 mile away will eventually come to you). After many years, they decided to allow bunny hopping as it became a common practice in unofficial games and tournaments, but they forbidden the use of mouse scroll as jump.Except acceleration and time distortion, there was another use of bunny hop. They used to bunny hop to entry and become more difficult targets to snipers. However, there's a huge difference here. In Counter Strike there was different dmg if you hit an arm, a leg or body. Snipers there have only 1 bullet at the time, and they one shot body and head, while you will not be killed if you are hit on the leg. This does not occur in Overwatch. Furthermore, overwatch heroes can aim while in the air, while counter strike characters are penalized. Therefore, bunnyhopping there, gives you high mobility with the drawback of not being able to hit.It's not easy to hit someone who bunny hops properly, even for a master... However who cares about ""hitting properly"" in overwatch? Just smash his legs and he takes the same dmg. Also, there's no such a thing as predictable bunnyhopping because velocity increases, but not linearly. It depends on the strafe at the given jump."

So you end up gliding out to the point and getting killed by an enemy you can't see.Mystery Heroes is the worst culprit at this as every game usually starts with the invisible heroes, except the pre-match countdown allows enough time for the heroes to render.POTGs are also broken in this way.

Do you even try to counter the hero? do you work with your team to defeat him? you keep trying the same thing over and over again?1.- Junkrat counters bad coordination easily, if your team keeps going in the exact same place Junkrat is spamming your team is just gonna receive severe dmg if not die. 2.- If junkrat jumps on your tank and kill it, its entirely your teams fault for not killing him, he puts himself at high risk and you guys just ignore him leading to the dead of your tank.3.- Self dmg was removed because it was a huge drawback to him, Junkrat is suppose to dominate at close range and having the self dmg didnt allow that, people actually (Especially tanks) used to just walk towards him to make himself receive dmg and then just kill him easily. -- The Pharah comparison doesnt make sense if you are at range to dmg yourself     has Pharah is your fault.4.- If you wanna kill him DONT fight him at close range always keep your distance, at long range he basically cant dmg you, at medium range you just have to evade his nades and the mine since is slow is pretty inefficient at medium range. (i win against him most of the time thanks to this) -- You could also try to flank him, his hitbox is pretty big (just like Zens) making     him a easy kill if you jump on him5.- Junkrat CANT one-shot without his Rip-Tire or the help of Zen or Mercy (And even with their help he can only oneshot Tracer and D.va unless both are helping him) 6.-  The double mine thing... he is wasting his mines if he killed you using both, he just used his tools to escape making him an easy kill. (And again dont try to fight him at close range) 7.- Im sure someone if gonna come up with this, Junkrat was trash before his buffs i keep hearing people saying that he shouldnt had got any buff. Im sure some of them they didnt even play him way back then.The Most important thing Im sure that im speaking for over 80% of the Junkrat mains that... We all agree with a charge rate nerf on the Rip-Tire we know it charge fast but the rest of his kit is fine as it is. And i know the reason of this because when he got his double mine and the tire buff, the devs didnt put in consideration the charge rate, Pre-buff Junkrat was to inconsistent but now that he is, he can charge his tire easier and faster thats what they overlook."

That's just a feature of the character. ""Genji isn't OP, because he picks off people from behind enemy lines because of his quick mobility""The problem, as I understand it, isn't that he has area denial. It's that he can deny multiple areas at once through grenades, mines, and trap. Posted by DarkCat2.- If junkrat jumps on your tank and kill it, its entirely your teams fault for not killing him, he puts himself at high risk and you guys just ignore him leading to the dead of your tank.""He isn't OP because you guys didn't shoot him!""That's not an argument? You're just saying that because he did something risky, he isn't OP just because it worked out. You're technically right on that, but if Junkrat can jump onto a tank and then kill the tank before the tank can kill him or the other team can kill him, that's a problem. Since Junkrat can deal (at most) 460 damge in one second (assuming there are two mines thrown, the enemy is trapped, and he hits with one grenade), it's reasonable to say that's a little ridiculous.Posted by DarkCat3.- Self dmg was removed because it was a huge drawback to him, Junkrat is suppose to dominate at close range and having the self dmg didnt allow that, people actually (Especially tanks) used to just walk towards him to make himself receive dmg and then just kill him easily. Yeah self damage is to make sure you can't just run in and guarantee you do 120 damage every single shot. Having a guaranteed 120 DPS is ridiculous, frankly. Self damage existed so that explosion based characters would have to keep their range, meaning that you could theoretically kill them with a well timed shield or body block. Posted by DarkCatThe Pharah comparison doesnt make sense if you are at range to dmg yourself has Pharah is your fault.A comparison to Pharah is valid. If you're saying the reason Junkrat would die to self damage was because people would rush him, then that also applies to Pharah. People can rush Pharah down and make her kill herself on self damage. Range is irrelevant, we're talking about rushing someone down.Posted by DarkCat4.- If you wanna kill him DONT fight him at close range always keep your distance, at long range he basically cant dmg you, at medium range you just have to evade his nades and the mine since is slow is pretty inefficient at medium range. (i win against him most of the time thanks to this)In a strictly 1v1 scenario, sure. That'd work. But, in a team game, if your team is working together you won't be able to get that sightline on Junkrat because his team will take you out. You're not wrong, technically, but it's a moot point because it isn't a 1v1 situation.Posted by DarkCat5.- Junkrat CANT one-shot without his Rip-Tire or the help of Zen or Mercy (And even with their help he can only oneshot Tracer and D.va unless both are helping him)No one can one-shot unless it's Hanzo or Widow. That's a moot point.And he can effectively oneshot any hero below 340 HP (trap + 2 mines). Think the hook combo, while that wasn't technically a oneshot, it sure felt one.Posted by DarkCat6.- The double mine thing... he is wasting his mines if he killed you using both, he just used his tools to escape making him an easy kill.It won't matter if he has no escape after he's killed you, because in this scenario, it's a 1v1. If he's in the middle of your team, then his Total Mayhem means that he's still denying an area even though he died. There isn't a negative to that scenario. He either gets a pick and gets away, or he trades and denies area. No downside.Posted by DarkCat7.- Im sure someone if gonna come up with this, Junkrat was trash before his buffs i keep hearing people saying that he shouldnt had got any buff. Im sure some of them they didnt even play him way back then.I used to play Junkrat a lot. He always felt fine. I like his 2 mine change, but the self damage thing is kinda stupid.

846,https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760626703,To the Junkrat NERF posts,NA,"This is a post I made in an another thread about his pickrate/winrate. I'll just c/p it here since it's relevantJunkrat start with 7.76% pickrate and go dow to 3.29% in GM, where his winrate goes to  47.42% to 57.76% in GMSymmetra starts with 2.05% pickrate and goes down to 0.86% in GM, where her winrate stays consistently at the average 59%, except on bronze, which is 56%,and as equal, torbjorn goes to 1.73% to 0.51% , and 52.96% to 56%, an average across all the ranks.Tracer goes from 2.45% to 7,76%  pickrate and 43.67% to 54.46% winrate, and almost the same ocurrs with genji, which goes from 3.00% to 6.54% and a winrate of 44.91% to 54.33%.With this stats, i can see Symmetra, Torbjorn and Junkrat Pickrates decay, but their winrates go up, where Tracer and Genji go to the Oposite. both pickrates and winrates go up. But why? The explanation goes into my mind is that the more up you go the ladder, the best you deal with the heroes with Decaying pickrate (Junk, Symmetra, Torbjorn), and the only ones remaining is the One Trick/ Mains of those heroes. Yet the GM/Master rank is filled with good Hitscan/Mobility heroes, with can be more effective overall.Yet i still fail to see in which point those heroes with a Higher Winrate and Low Pickrate are OP across all the ranks. if he is op, why his pickrate is decaying?The GM's and Masters fail to see how that hero is OP and choose to pick a weaker one?Thanks for proving that you don't understand what ""skewed winrate"" means. Torbjorn and Symmetra have skewed winrates because they are usually picked on 1st point of 2CP and Hybrid maps. Meaning, if the game results in a hold, they will both get credited with a full victory because during the entire defense round, they played that hero. However, if the hold is not succesful, people will usually swap from those heroes. And if the game is lost in the end, they will only get a 50% of the loss or 33% of the loss, depending on whether it's 2 CP or Hybrid.That's why they have unusually high winrates and very low pickrates. Same thing applies to their pickrate. For example, Torbjorn has a 0.65% pickrate in Platinum. That means that you would only see a Torb once in every 13 games. Which clearly isn't the case. Symmetra has 0.88% pickrate. Which means that you would see her once every ~10 games. Which also clearly isn't the case. That's why those are skewed. And as for the rest of your argument, it's normal that a characters winrate goes up as rank increases. Why? Because people in rank X don't play only versus rank X people. They also play versus people ranked higher than them and people ranked lower than them. To make an extreme example:Players in bronze play versus players in bronze but they also play versus players in silver. And generally, they will lose more to players in silver than they will win against them.Other end of it is grandmaster. GM plays against GM but they also play against Masters and sometimes even Diamond. And they will generally win versus diamonds more than diamonds will win against them. So you won't get much information looking at the pure winrate in some rank alone. But if you take a look at what happens with the winrate of the hero in a rank in relation to other heroes in the rank, that is a better indicator.Junkrat has the 2nd highest winrate and the highest pickrate out of all DPS characters in Bronze. Bastion has the highest winrate but Bastion also has 5 times smaller pickrate.Junkrat has the highest winrate and the highest pickrate out of all DPS characters in Silver. Junkrat has the highest winrate and the highest pickrate out of all DPS characters in Gold. Junkrat has the highest winrate and the 4th highest pickrate out of all DPS characters in Platinum. His pickrate is the 4th highest but they are all close (McCree 5.15%, Genji - 4.94%, 76 - 4.67%, Junkrat 4.52%)Junkrat has the highest winrate and the 6th highest pickrate out of all DPS characters in Diamond. Most picked is Genji with almost 6%. Junkrat has 3.86% pickrateJunkrat has the highest winrate and the 5th highest pickrate out of all DPS characters in Masters. Most picked is Genji with 6.32%. Junkrat has 3.54% pickrateJunkrat has the highest winrate and the 5th highest pickrate out of all DPS characters in Grandmaster. Most picked is Tracer with 7.76%. Junkrat has 3.29% pickrate.So, in essence, you see that even in GM, he still sees stable usage. 3.3% pickrate roughly translates to having a Junkrat on one of the teams that won't switch for the entire duration of the game in 2 out of 5 games. In every rank, he consistently stays at top of DPS characters with a very stable pickrate.For example, you take Pharah, which is a problem in some ranks for some people. She is the 2nd highest winrate DPS character in gold, platinum, diamond. Already in masters she loses a spot and drops to 3rd place and 76 takes her place. In GM she drops to 7th place in terms of winrate out of DPS characters. Why? Because hitscan skill drastically increases as you climb the ranks and she becomes very hard to play. Same thing with Tracer. Tracer has a negative winrate until diamond and masters where she is barely positive with 50.5% and on the bottom of the list of DPS characters. But then, in GM, she suddenly goes to 54.46%, putting her in the 4th place after Junkrat, Doomfist and 76. And that also makes sense. She's hard to get consistent value out of unless you're really good at tracking and have superior game sense (needed for every character but especially for her). In literally every other rank, you're better of playing 76 than Tracer. And that makes sense. But the fact that Junkrat is still up there even in GM suggests serious balance issues. More specifically, overpowered kit from which it is very easy to get value out of even in highest ranks."

If he's at range, you can see them with plenty of time to move, and if he's not in any danger then he's either behind a shield or he can't see what he's shooting at.You also pointed out the relevance of the comparison yourself by noting that they are both characters that prey on others mistakes.Besides, I chose Sym as an example because you were complaining about trap being annoying. My solution? If you know they have a Junkrat, check for traps. Either destroy them or pick another route. You know, the same way that if you know they have a Sym you don't just casually stroll through a choke point... you either destroy the turrets or you pick another route...If Junkrat is firing at you in a way that simply moving aside will dodge the projectile, he's not doing it right. If the projectiles land at your feet, you need to clear the blast zone, and with more bombs coming in at a very high pace (Unlike with Symmetra's RMB), your movement space is going to be very limited, which makes you vulnerable to getting picked off or dying because you tripped over a bomb that's been lying there for five seconds.Apart from the fact that some maps don't really give you a choice outside of going through the chokepoint (Eichenwalde, Hanamura, Volskaya), in Symmetra's case you do actually kind of just flat-out walk through the chokepoint. Carwashes are immensely inefficient defense strategies, they take forever to set up and are brought down in about .2 seconds with hard counters, and 2 seconds with anyone else. Symmetra preys on enemy mistakes in terms of her own positioning, and her ultimate. She punishes enemies who are thoroughly unaware of their surroundings and allow her to sneak up on them from behind, and she punishes enemies who do not hunt down her ultimate. Junkrat punishes people who play on the objective, because he doesn't -need- to see his targets, everything he has is excessive damage in AoE format. The general direction of the target is enough for him, much like it is enough for a Hanzo ult. ""Just pick a different chokepoint!"" also works against Symmetra much more than against Junkrat, because turning your camera takes less time than setting up a whole new car wash."

Once you get that, everything else falls into place. Game awareness will keep you updated on who needs healing and where, and GA mechanics help in staying alive when in combination to game awareness. Moira needs to balance between attacking and healing to be effective. I have out-healed too many Moiras as Zenyatta without using his trans, and that shouldn't happen imo when she has almost 3x the amount of healing he does, without the use of her orb. However, she does still need to do damage because she needs it to charge her healing resource meter. So, that balance is necessary, and hard to maintain if you're not used to it."

Sounds nice, I am down. It will greatly help her durability over the course of the game. However in direct engagements it won't exactly be game changing (I.e. being dove by Gengu).Well, Zenyatta's regen and Mercy's regen don't save them when they're under attack, they just function as sustain. Lucio is already slippery as hell. Its job isn't to save her from flankers, just like it doesn't save Zenyatta and Mercy from flankers. She also has her sleep dart, decent damage, and her grenade if it's a tight spot.This suggestion is to help her sustain, which is sorely limited. Not just compared to other supports, but compared to other heroes. Other heroes have abilities or ways to heal themselves, many of them can afford to leave the team for a few seconds to grab a health kit, and all of them almost always have a support watching their backs. If you're a solo healer, you don't have any of that except your own sustain, and Ana doesn't even have that much.tl;dr it's not meant to be a life-saving game changer. It's meant to fix the problem of her having zero sustain."
892,https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760636807,What if Ana gained health by healing allies?,12/22/2017 8:59,"She does have something of a sustain issue, and using the grenade on yourself to heal is a huge sacrifice. Out of the healers, Zenyatta and Lucio aren't great solo healers but have regenerating shields and a heal aura respectively. Mercy is a main/solo healer with innate regen and Moira is a main/solo healer with oodles of sustain, but Ana is kind of left behind in this regard, which limits her ability to be a main or solo healer.So maybe instead of just health regen like Mercy, how about when healing allies, each shot grants her a small amount of health? Not enough to make her immune or anything, but enough to grant her sustain to hang around without being a 10hp target for flankers or needing to abandon the team to find a health pack. I don't know numbers, but maybe 10-15 a shot, or a percentage of the healing done, similar to Reaper's passive.I'm obviously no pro, but it might help make her feel better to play, and make her a bit more viable. Can we at least try it out?"

947,https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760636877,Small Torb Buffs,12/23/2017 1:23,"Before people freak out on me because torb is wrecks in their elo realize that Torbs performance decreases hugely the higher rank you go. Plus these buffs are targeted more towards higher on the ladder anyway. So I’m sure minor nerfs could come with a change, but this thread is for buffs. 1. ReloadTorbs reload is painfully slow it is the third slowest reload in the game (I think) yet can be gone through pretty quickly. I would suggest lowering the reload from 2 secs to 1.5. It isn’t a super big buff, but it would get rid of that frustration. Secondly, his ult should have even quicker reload or unlimited ammo. Nothing is worse than you just shredding through your clip with increased firing speed, but having to take a 2 sec break in the middle.2. Head HitboxHis head hitbox is way to large. It’s literally like a watermelon. He just absolutely gets destroyed by mcrees, hanzos, and soldiers. Not to mention his head hitbox takes up a lot of his torso leading to body shots being crits. We need to lower the hitbox so it actually covers his head and then we’ll be good.3. Unhack Yes, Sombra is underpowered and needs a buff. At the same time though when a Sombra emps to push in I want to immediately core when I’m unhacked so I could potentially stop the push. But you can’t, for whatever reason it takes longer to unhack than you. Just why? It doesn’t make sense.4. Pack to upgrade This one is definitely the most buffiest of all them, but it is aimed at attack torb. People ask me what would make attack torb viable by the average Joe. I tell them nothing will, but this would help. Right now amour pack serves one purpose, to give armour (it’s kinda in the title lol), but I think it could serve another purpose. Throwing an armour pack on a lvl 1 turret instantly upgrades it to a lvl 2. This can lead to pushes with immediate lvl 2s or even lvl3s with core. It also would only help on defense when your turret is destroyed and it is a team fight which isn’t too powerful, but still good.So thoughts, anything to add, or think torb is fine. This post will probably get downvoted, but we have to face it, he needs a buff."

I think it would be like if Mei's freeze+icicle worked on even less heroes... it's an important part of her kit. Junkrat is actually strong against Doomfist, but that's largely due to his big hitbox and his need to deal damage up close. Zarya can make him a huge liability. It's not like the guy doesn't have his counters, I think one of the reasons people are so mad is because he's more common in games these days and he can be frustrating, and they experience that much more... but I don't think that's only due to his buffs, a lot of things that irritate people existed before those...I think it's okay to look at making some minor changes to him, but it's important for people to consider a way that doesn't remove him from viability entirely. I'd be happy to see Roadhog completely gone, but Roadhog mains don't want that so all I can do is shrug my shoulders and accept that I'll always run into him from time to time.

Junkrat must choose where to lay his traps and where to throw bombs when he is using indirect support - he needs to manage the push and pull to decide when to advance and engage directly or even flank or instead apply indirect pressure/area denial - the better Junkrats seem to have a ""psychic"" sense of where someone is going to go and will already have a mine ready'Traps are not the problem. His spam is not the problem. Burst damage without any falloff in the entire blast radius done by his mines is. And he has 2 of those. Hitting with grenades from a distance directly isn't easy - it is a slow projectile and it's arc, like Mei's delay is just one more thing to have to take into account when aimingThat's why they gave him a high rate of fire and high damage to compensate for that. When his opponents are not stupidly feeding, the rat player needs to be canny and smart in order to maintain impact comparable to simply taking Tracer or GenjiHE SHOULD NOT HAVE IMPACT COMPARABLE TO HEROES WHO ACTUALLY TAKE SKILLA GAME THAT REWARDS SKILLESS HEROES OVER HEROES THAT ACTUALLY TAKE SKILL IS A POORLY DESIGNED GAMESeriously, just kill him from outside of mine range - like if Genji actually kill him entirely with ranged shuirkens rather than relying on triple shuriken to the face and or swift-strike like a crutch - you know, use that ""skill"" that Genji mains are always yammering aboutYes because there are not covers on every map everywhere. And barriers are not a thing. At all. Yes, this means the best move may be to not approach a control point or a payload until Junkrat has been killed or you have a team push with a numbers advantage - it's comparable to how D.Va suppresses certain ults until she has been de-mechedJunkrat will literally never go down first unless he gets cocky and misplays.Stop spreading bad propaganda."

If a Genji uses a Reflect to Dash, he will win the fight and dash out. Why does somebra get the short end of the stick?I would like to know how many health packs I have hacked on the UI.

Sure, I shouldn't be able to blow her out of the sky, but I should at least be able to land 3 bullets out of 60.Don't get me started on how inconsistent EMP is with stopping Ultimates mid cast.

Tracer can blink in your face three times and blast you with one clip, Junkrat can launch himself up in the air shoot you once then throw mine at you and boom you’re dead, Genji can quickly shoot a few Shurikens at your head, swift strike through you, turn around and use your own abilities against you with his Deflect, but yet Sombra can’t come out of Stealth without saying an entire sentence having the entire team notice her before she can even shoot one bullet?? Umm.. HELLOOO!! Shes a STEALTH HERO.. thats what they do, catch you by suprise!! That doesn’t make her OP, that just fits her playstyle, if you know theirs an enemy Sombra, be aware of her flanking you!! It’s not rocket science to make a 180° turn and fight back, especially when your team is there with you. I mean cmon, Blizzard acts like Sombra coming out of Stealth turns her weapon into a giant nuclear laser that melts your insides.. Sombra deserves to at least be on level with Genji and Tracer people have been saying that for over a year now if anything, it's only helping her get out of the blackhole she's stuck in.Also D.VA is not a problem at all it’s very easy to get her out of her Mech, you weren’t paying attention to the problem, the point is that D.VAs little pellets across the map take you out of Stealth with 1 damage which is ridiculous, Sombras abilities get canceled more than the enemies shes trying to hack, that’s just not right. Sombra can be very effective being a disruptor dealing a bit of damage than teleporting away to farm her EMP, but her ultimate should not be her #1 priority when it comes to good viability. Sombra is only viable because of her EMP, hence why everyone literally uses her as a Support, even the OWL uses her to fill a Support Slot because all she can do is farm her EMP and give heals, while not dealing enough damage.  Sombra needs power shifted away from her constant EMP farming, and more power onto her actual kit so she can be more viable on her own without having to hold her teammates hands after she spent the entire game teleporting back and forth intentionally taking damage to gain ultimate charge?? Not to mention her Machine Pistol spread.. how is she supposed to be the hero that “finishes people off” if she can’t even get to the low HP enemy thats most likely behind their teammates, and theirs a 99% chance that you’ll get shot out of Stealth forcing you to teleport away, not even getting the finish on them. Even if you don’t have to get near them, its not like you can shoot them at a distance either, her Weapon spread is ridiculous so the bullets are hardly ever going to hit them to finish them off, Sombras gun acts like a target thats 10 feet away is actually far away on another planet.A stealth hero like Sombra has so much potential yet she acts like a broken record going back and forth. There was even a bug when she was first released that allowed players to get rid of the Stealth delay and it worked fine and felt way smoother than what it is now and it wasn’t OP at all. And ofcourse, Sombra is already pretty good, but any hero can be good for the little amount of players that invest so much time into playing them, but that doesn’t make the hero good or the other 99% of the playerbase.Sure, Blizzard might’ve said they don’t want Sombra to be an assassin, but that was a year ago, look how their plan turned out, all Sombra is, is an EMP bot that is counted as a Support Hero. It makes no sense. It’s been over a year and Sombra has been more worthless than Doomfist considering her release date.Blizzard has to change Sombra, they didn’t like how Mercy and D.VA were Resurrect bots and Defense Matrix bots, so they reworked them and even gave them new abilities, Sombra needs the same treatment."

Although I would not be biased to him hurting himself again with his own explosives. Do the mines need to be nerfed? Honestly I don't think so, they really have given him the much needed mobility and versatility he's needed. Making him hurt himself again would be a simple revert that would punish incredibly reckless Junkrats from just, well, being reckless.

Junkrat wasn't just ""trash tier"" prior to him hurting himself, he was a legitimate liability and anyone with 400+ hp could just walk up to him and stand on top of him to make him die instantly.  Blizzard changed it 12 months ago because it was an awful design.  This was also back in the day when Winston had less mobility and a long barrier cd, and we didn't have Orisa who now could just fire a shield in front of JR and laugh as he dies instantly.  OP is a Widow/Handsoap main (he also plays Gengu and Tracer, which explains the JR hate).  Both are incredibly strong counters to JR and should be getting to places he can't spam-choke.  Stop being bad, and stop trying to 1v1 JR in a confined space.  If those aren't working for you, switch to one of the other JR counters like Winston, RH, Zarya, S76, McCree, Pharah, Dva, Sombra or Moira.  Posted by UkeNickyI especially feel bad for Doomfist. He just can't do anything against a JunkratHave you tried flanking instead of standing directly in front of him and charging up a punch?

Even a good gengi can be countered by a decent winston. Tracer on the other hand... mcree is a high skill hero that few people can actually reliably counter tracer with, people rarely pick torb and get flammed when they do and sym isnt a great choice either (especially with moiras orb atm) , and those are some of tacers best counters. even the pros just pick another tracer to counter tracer and no hero should require you to pick the same hero to counter it. So onto Mei. Her spray already reduces movement speed but by the time it freezes an enemy they can get in, kill their target and get out before being frozen. Even though people complain about mei's freeze,  theirs a reason shes not popular in death match and rarely used at diamond and above. So now the actual mei buff:-1 SLIGHTLY increase her freeze speed or SLIGHTLY increase its range maybe 1 or 2 meters-2 Her ice spray reduces the distance travelled of movement skills, so once you start being sprayed, your blink/ dash/ leap/ jump jet/ doomfist/ boosters etc has its effectiveness (travel distance) reduced over time. It takes about 1.5 seconds to freeze an enemy so for every 0.5 secs you lose 1/3 of the travel distance of a movement skill while her chill effect is in place.-3 Icicle has a slow effect that lasts for 0.5 seconds. Example:  D.va is being sprayed by mei and uses boosters to escape (12m travel distance). 0.5s of being sprayed = 8m travelled by boosters, 1second of being sprayed = on 4 meters travelled by boosters and 1.5s sprayed = frozen.So in short, She should be the character that speed based heroes are afraid to get close to. This will also ensure dive doesnt become to dominant again without having to nerf any of those heroes."

The Shimada dragons and Zenyatta's robo-Buddha orbs imply that magic does exist in the Overwatch universe, so it's not so far-fetched that Ana has some sort of magic darts and fluid that are actually just hexed or something. I mean otherwise she'd just be a stupid character that got wedged in as a cool idea with little regard for the non-biotic and armored cast.Of course this would open up more possibilities. Widowmaker's nerve-gas mine, Moira's Golden Shower healing (you can't convince me that that's science no matter how hard you try), and even Reaper's health-leech (RIP Soul Orbs) could all just be magic.

1419,https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760676960,Some Mei Tips - For Fun!,12/22/2017 20:39,"Now some of these may be a skosh outdated (or lack extensive testing) but, I saw a thread asking people to share 1 tip about their main (or Mein; in my case) and I couldn't decide on 1 tip! So I compiled a list of little tips that I have found to be valuable and that I have learned in my time playing Mei so far and I wanted to share my knowledge! Now I know Mei could use some QOL changes and a few tweaks here or there but, regardless of that, I really enjoy her and always have! So here goes nothing. I hope you guys enjoy and make use of these!Mei Tips:-You can freeze somebody in a couple seconds with primary fire. The stream from Mei's gun is actually more of consecutive ""puffs,"" if you will, (Like tiny clouds) than an actual stream of fire. The best policy for a quick freeze is to aim, as closely as possible to an enemy and where the enemy WILL BE as oppose to where they currently are. Because Mei's weapon is not hitscan, this results in a more reliable freeze. This helps, particularly, with denying mobile heroes.-On that same note, it is best to attempt a freeze on heroes after they have used their escapes. I.E. A Genji who has just dashed into your back line, a tracer who is absent-mindedly blinking and recalling, a Sombra who has just trans-located, a Moira who has just phased, etc.-Mei's freeze is a great tool for not only securing kills but interrupting enemies. Flank and bum-rush heroes mid-ult to be extra annoying.Most of the time a McRee or a Road Hog are ulting, they are focusing on getting kills; not you. This can result in a reliable stop to many ults and sometimes a kill. Heck, it can even be useful to interrupt healing!-Zarya can bubble frozen heroes to cleanse a freeze. You can also activate her personal bubble as she is about to freeze to cleanse the slow and deny an impending freeze.-If you listen closely to the sound being broadcast as somebody comes close to freezing, you can actually time RMB just right and hit enemies right as they freeze. This can result in you being able to land up to a triple headshot on heroes. Combined with a punch, at the end, this can kill even some Tanks.-You can use Mei's Ice Block as cover - similar to her wall. (You can also Iceblock on top of frozen enemies and create extra cover for allies) I have jumped in front of a D.Va bomb and saved allies many times (Or so it appears).-Mei's iceblock can also be canceled early. This can help take enemies off-guard or helps you to avoid being trapped and mined by a Junkrat (Junk Mine can 1-shot Mei due to her hitbox)-Mei Iceblock now cleanses Ana grenade (This was a 2+ year-long bug)-Mei wall can be put under your feet or allied hero's feet to break Junkrat traps instantly (It can also be used on enemies postmortem for hilarious body launches).-Similarly, you can actually place a Mei wall under your own feet and jump right as it peaks to avoid being hurt by a Doomfist ult; when timed properly it completely avoids it.-Another fun thing is to place a wall between you and the enemy team as soon as a Zarya ult lands (Remember, you can drop your wall whenever you feel like it). You can also wall-off Mcree ults this way. This can really take people off-guard or even lure enemies into a false sense of security only to have your wall dropped and them ulted.-Use her wall to sneak around choke points guarded by Torb turrets or Bastions. Each pillar can eat 500 or so damage before breaking.-Mei wall eats Moira orbs and can completely ruin her planned trajectory for them.-You can also use Mei's wall to trap enemies in allied hero ults such as Road Hog or Pharah or Secure a Doomfist punch kill.-When dueling a Doomfist, as Mei, you can win every time. Just wait for him to let out a rocket punch and block it with an ability, do the same as he tries to spam abilities and, with proper tracking, you'll freeze and icicle his face in no time (Just try to avoid dueling close to walls).-Similarly, you can block Rein charges.-Mei wall shines when it is used to split enemy teams and secure kills. It can, however, also be used defensively to negate nasty ults like a D.Va bomb. You can use it to wall yourself into corners, indoors, to save yourself from Winstons, Genjis, and other ults too. I recommend blocking Moira ult, Road Hog Ult, and D.Va Ult with it. You can even block some junkrat ults with good timing.-Use Mei wall to sneak up into high positions and freeze enemy snipers. Note that they will be the bane of your existence in-game but, even some experienced snipers suffer from tunnel vision and will fall victim to a freeze and the following abrupt icicle lobotomy; without proper attention.-Fun Fact: You can use Mei Wall, when placed under your feet and far enough onto the corner, on the second point of Hanamura to sneak in the back way. Just jump as you reach the edge of your wall and you will make it!-Mei's RMB can 1-shot a Tracer if you can plant one in her noggin. It is also one of the fastest ways to charge your ult. Be sure to try and land headshots on Tanks like D.VA &amp; Road Hog. They can basically be your personal ult battery.-Fun Fact: Mei's ult requires a little longer to charge than your average ult.-Use Mei icicles in your downtime to poke and charge your ult and to harass Pharahs. Even though it has fall-off damage, the poke you provide can help secure kills and ward off pesky attackers/flankers - even if you aren't getting head shots. Remember, Mei's icicle also has a slight arc at longer ranges. An experienced Mei can out-duel other long-range heroes at mid-range. Just time the RMB fire delay right!-Be sure to flank unsuspecting Reinhardts (Especially if you can catch them alone). You can shoot a freeze ray up their butts and stun them - effectively locking them out of their barrier and potentially exposing the enemy team or securing a kill. It should also be noted that you can literally run circles around some Reins and use your primary fire to freeze them even if they are trying to block you.-During Mei ult, you can freeze somebody with primary fire in less than a second (with good aim). Use this on heroes you know can escape (Which is most of them). You can also lightly touch heroes with your primary and they will freeze in the order you specify. As far as I know, as long as they are in your ult, they will stay frozen. For this reason, Mei Ult never actually NEEDS to be paired with any other ult. Just mop up some free Popsicle kills.-FUN FACT: Roughly 25 of the heroes have a very high chance of escaping your ult if they are paying attention.-In regards to her ult, the best policy is to throw it when you are unseen. You can throw it straight up to delay its activation or you can simply throw it behind the enemy team, when pushing, and they will back into it. Alternatively, use your wall to close the enemy team's escape. No need to be shy, get in there and start shooting some icicles!-Mei's ult can be canceled by D.Va Matrix or even deflected by a skilled Genji; before it lands. Keep this in mind as a deflected Mei ult can wind up securing your enemy a team kill.-Mei ult also freezes enemies slightly above or below it.-Mei shines on payload maps. Her little body can actually effectively hide behind almost every single payload; when she crouches. This protects you from 90+% of enemy fire and snipers and forces them to run up to the payload to get you off of it. This puts them right in freezing range. Wall them off, freeze them, and secure a kill on your over-extended and unprotected new friend.-Mei is a-mei-zing at staling points and payloads. Many Meins don't like the fact that this is part of her character but, it serves teams well often enough. Use your wall and iceblock to be pesky and stall points until your team arrives. This is exceptionally helpful during overtime.-Mei can function as an off-tank when played well.-As Mei, Snipers, discord orbs, and Pharah's will prove tough to handle. Use LOS well and practice countering people. Discord orb falls off after 3 seconds out of Zen's LOS (So does Harmony). #Itgetsbetter.-Lastly, Mcree will be your arch nemesis. Bait out his flash bang, in close range, and Iceblock or wall to negate it. After that, dance around and freeze him. If he doesn't headshot you at least twice, you will probably win the duel. Don't forget: There is a slight delay between iceblock and wall activation that lets bullets and effects through. This can result in a canceled Iceblock and death or getting headshot through your wall. Time it appropriately.Have fun my little Ice Queens!"

Also way too many characters have some sort of strange auto-resistance to knockback effects so they stop before they hit the wall, or worse, ones like Tracer/Genji recall/dash out of it despite their stunned status the moment they hit the wall.Also, doorframes due to their strange rounded angles still cause enemies to bounce off of them without taking damage.They said they still had some work to do on him though so hopefully when they finish the next round of bug fixes for him in Jan he'll be a bit better."

Instead use him to kill genjis and tracers or reapers (careful if you miss, he’ll destroy you in a couple shots otherwise), blow Winston out of his bubble- use him to disrupt reins on the front line, blowing him way back and out of position. If you’re quick you can uppercut him, “tap” him with an RP to really get some distance on him (great on maps with fall offs, straight up delete him with nothing he can do about it!), and then use slam to escape back behind your team.

I mean like, Overwatch is such a story-based game, why shouldn't there be a reason why the hereos fight? A Tracer killing Winston? Or even worse, Winston killing Winston? As you may already noticed, it doesn't make sense at all and still I haven't found an official explanation why that happens.So, let me tell you my theories about that topic :D (Please excuse any mistakes I make, English is not my mother tongue nor I live in an english speaking country)1. Overwatch itself is a training program for the hereos of Overwatch &gt; The hereos of Overwatch can train their skills without killing actual people (or things) in a simulation (maybe made by Athena?) to train their skills. Good Overwatch hereos can fight against good Overwatch hereos to train their skills and be prepared for a worst-case scenario (maybe a blackwatch hereo who can hack into the minds of people... who knows...)2. Overwatch, the game we play right now, is a game made for people to trust more into Overwatch&gt; Overwatch could be somekind of merchandise or... well, a game made by that Overwatch museum we saw in the original trailer to build up more trust for Overwatch. It's a well known game in the world and people can play with their favorite hereos, along with lots of ow merchandise and fan posters hanging in their rooms. :DI can't think of more reasons, what's your opinion on that topic?

So despite how much I hate him, I shrug my shoulders, accept that he'll be in the game, and live with it. I don't go making threads on the forums about how he needs a nerf.Everyone has characters in the game they don't like. Doesn't mean they should be nerfed into the ground so you don't have to play against them."

Even the devs know what they're adovocating shouldn't be done in Competitive, yet they're not gonna take action.

Why not just remove the melee attack. In fact why not just remove Ana completely, you tortured her enough with nerfs and releasing much better and dummer characters that doesn't even have to aim.New nerf ideas; 1. Ana's ulti now doesn't buff anyone. We decided that it is better than buffing just one person for 0 seconds.2. Ana's rifle will hit your allies everytime you try to shoot an enemy, even if there are no allies at your screen. Now Ana heals %99999 billion million more because thats exactly what she needs, just look at her visage, she doesn't look like a deadly sniper at all she doesn't have to do damage even if she have to aim but non-aim characters should do %99999999999999999999999999999999999999 more damage.3. Ana's bullets will go %999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 slower now, It wont make any difference since it already goes at 0 cm per hour. You want to shoot someone? You don't need aiming skills because you need psychic skills, you need to see the future."

Or nerf Valkyrie. She has the most consistent healing in the game, and really good mobility.  She fits a roll no other healer can fulfill.- Ana gets bufu'd by flankers cause of her lack of mobility, and by barriers for healing. Requires a really high skill to land and duel any sort of flank coming at you. Zenny follows this philosophy too.- Lucio is okay. Ultimate change hurt him a lot. Wall ride change hurt him a lot. I stopped playing Lucio outside of closed beta so I don't really want to comment on what I feel he needs. - Zenyatta is interesting. He is rather easy to kill, but you still got to respect him. He can heal through barriers, but his healing is super low. Maybe since he single target heals, and the orb requires line of sight to stay on longer it should get a buff? Not sure.- Moira is absolutely fun. Great mobility, interesting gameplay. She suffers from the lack of consistent healing, and the nerf to her orb hitting barriers really stopped her from opening up chokes. I don't think she needs any changes outside of the healing orb not being able to get eaten by DVA/Reflected by genji. While she does get high healing numbers, it is sort of like what Lucio used to do before he got nerfed in that her healing is usually spread out and in really large bursts. She isn't as consistent as Mercy, and has no aerial access like Mercy as well.Mercy is the hardest to kill of the healers cause of her mobility is only limited by your team. A Moira playing selfishly is pretty good at surviving too, but she has limited healing resource where as Mercy does not. So until there is another high mobility, single target healer that doesn't get punished by barriers, and doesn't run out of resource Mercy will always be a good pick."

And %100 pickrate means more than viable = so hood mandatory.What is viable anyway mean to u. Unkillable and overly strong. Still no arguments address the fact she has a near perfect pickrate and is always the choice.I am just arguing that we should not only judge a hero's power-level based on pick-rate alone, but also take the role into account. Otherwise there is going to be constant nerfs to Mercy until we come to a tipping point where it makes no sense playing Mercy at all. Mercy fulfils a unique role as the only dedicated healer that focuses solely on keeping team-members alive, and as such she'll have the highest pick-rate even if she ends up being completely balanced... If they keep nerfing her at that point just because she still has high pick-rate she'll end up being underpowered.Well ya that's the point she needs to hit a tipping point then possibly get a small buff after. Why should she not be on that line(tipping point) while ever other hero is much closser to it.Arguing you shouldn't balance her at all bc eventually she will be underwhelming is just dumb.It's like saying ya big businesses we're out of control in the industrial revolution but let's not put any labor laws in place or businesses might all leave."

You will see Junkrat mains posting in threads around and saying how the ""only thing he needs is an ult charge nerf"" which is basically their attempt to compromise on a nerf because they know that it is coming but the true thing that needs nerfing are mines. And a slight ult charge nerf. By reducing the damage on mines, it will also reduce the speed of charging of his ultimate. Because currently, mines are what enable him to do so. He simply throws a mine into a group of enemies and boom, 120 damage flat to everyone in the radius. Then he throws an another one. He shouldn't be able to deal that much guaranteed damage. Currently, it is the by far the best source of burst damage in the game. And he has 2 of them. Damage that would otherwise likely be healed away. It means that as soon as 200 HP hero loses 40% of his healthpool to anything, he is likely dead. To a skillless ability. And he can even combo you with mines only, but it's rarer. By reducing the mine damage to 80, he still keeps his grenade + mine combo. He loses the trap + mine combo but it is rarely used anyways. The only time it's used is on the start of the round.

This allows you to do all kinds of cool stuff like launch yourself into a fight and still have a charge to escape with, or launch yourself up into a Pharah and still have a charge to try and kill her with. Previously this was possible before but you had to plant one on the ground and then wait for the cooldown to come back before doing this. That is still possible, which allows for a triple jump now if you want/need that, but now it is a lot more reliable to do with 2.

Besides, mine can be destroyed, if you get dived by a Winston or D.Va chances are that mine is destroyed the second they're on you (Winston's jetpack deals damage, and so does D.Va's boop, not to mentions she's probably already firing rockets and guns blazing). Fact is, if you prevent mine as an escape mechanic, he's a very, very easy target, and most people can just jump him since they have no need to fear him using mine offensively... he'd be trash.They could make it so it explodes immediately when its under you, so you could technically just point down and Shift to launch yourself. D.va is the only one that can reliably deny Junk Shift-while-in-someones-face combo. Currently you dont even have the time to blow up the mine. Like are you for real here? Has someone ACTUALLY managed to ever blow up the mine, before it has detonated in your face?

It takes minimal positionement and map awareness to be able to apply pressure with JR from range while out of line of sight thanks to the richochet nades.His only reliable hardcounters are Pharah and maybe Moira, but using cancer to kill cancer is not a cure guys.Moira does not counter him in any way, if anything he counters her due to his burst damage. Counters to Junkrat include: Pharah, Zarya, D.Va, a good Widow, a good Genji... he has counters, but the most reliable way of dealing with him is altering playstyle. Don't linger in chokes, don't go into enclosed spaces... If you see him as a huge threat, pick D.Va, Winston and Genji or Pharah, then all dive him at once and delete him before moving in...Hell D.Va alone can wreck Junkrat lol"

1957,https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760696925,Hanzo > Widow,NA,"Widow and Hanzo, while appearing very similar, are actually radically different skill sets. Hanzo is best at mid range, peeking corners, and spamming arrows. Body shots do 125 full charge, and his wall climb and sonic arrows provide useful situational benefits. Being a projectile, the arrows are actually somewhat easy to predict and avoid in comparison to widowmakers hitscan. 250 damage headshots vs 300 damage. Widowmaker is best at medium- long range. A hanzo close trumps you due to scattershot and quicker arrow charge. Widowmaker's hook is far better than wall climb, but its on a cooldown so it averages out imo. Try running from a winston or dva as hanzo... Try getting around reinhardt shield as hanzo... get to the top of the map as hanzo...  Killing pharah is FAR easier with widowmaker, as well as mercy and other high mobility characters minus scatter shot. Widowmaker and hanzo both have their situations that one is better than the other, but skill makes up the difference. A god tier widow will be useful where a ""decent"" hanzo is not, and vice versa. A widowmaker can down a roadhog in two shots; where hanzo needs three consecutive headshots to seal the deal. Is one better than the other? No. While both snipers, they both are different roles, and both perform incredibly different from each other."

If you run through a narrow choke, or try to 1v1 him up close and he destroys you... you didn't respect him.Besides, as far as double mine goes, remember that it's not instantaneous and many characters have escape abilities or offensive abilities that let them avoid it or stop Junkrat in his tracks. It also needs both to be off cooldown, and a double mine kill effectively has a 16 second cooldown.Bastion actually requires setup to do more than use a generic assault rifle. Junkrat just shows up out of nowhere, sprays 2-3 grenades and pies you in the face."
1983,https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760696933,A Junkrat main’s opinion on Junkrat,12/22/2017 18:57,"Posted by UkeNickyPosted by FreshKill14I want to get this off my chest, I love playing Junkrat, he was one of the first heroes I play next to Reaper (which explains the massive hours on them, currently I flex when I can). I was tired of seeing Junkrat in F-tier for so long that it felt like a miracle that Junkrat was getting buffed with two mines and tire speed increase.While I love Junkrat, however I feel he is a bit too “easy” to use than before which is one reason I don’t play him as much.I don’t share the sentiment of most Junkrat complainers wanting him to be nerfed back to F-tier, calling him “no-skill”, and even insulting other Junkrat players. I have been “in between” regarding Junkrat changes, as a Junkrat players I feel he is fine and the people are overreacting, but as a non-Junkrat player I can see why some people complain about him making it difficult for me to pick a side.I can guarantee if Blizzard is smart in toning down Junkrat so that he is still viable, I am sure it may help the game balance in the long run though I understand Junkrat players will feel upset about those changes believe me, I share that sentiment if he gets nerfed.TLDR: Junkrat is one of my favorite heroes in the game that it pains me wanting him toned down a bit. I don’t share the sentiment of most Junkrat complainers wanting him back to crap. However, can other Junkrat players convince me that he is fine, I will be open to your feedback.I'm joking so please don't get mad at me but you're just mad that he gets insta locked before you can pick him huh ;PHa, there is some truth to itBut surprisingly I see more Genji, Hanzo, and Widowmaker in QPWhenever I want to play Junkrat, he is usually available"

If you expect the game to do all of the work, then you might get bored. Overwatch gives you things to play with, you just have to use what is given. If playing the same hero for too long gets tiring, try someone else. If soloqueue sucks, try to put together a team of people you like. I've done both one-tricking in soloqueue and trying random heros in a group, and they both have their perks, but soloqueue is just not as replayable for me."

In fact they promote events primarily on the new skins that are releasing in that event. People buy loot boxes for the chance of getting a new event skin. I'm not against promoting skins but ask yourself why not just allow people to buy individual skins?You see a player with an unreal looking skin for your favourite hero and tell me they don't matter.Take a car for instance would you rather the latest ferrari or the old ford focus. Both will get you from A to B but it's the social and aesthetic value that it exudes which is the difference and cosmetic items in overwatch are no different."

Blizzard a multi billion dollar company decided they'll not pay employees till after the release. You evidently do not have a grasp of how a business functions. Considering I have a business degree I do understand. Blizzard would set a budget say $200 million for development, marketing and staff salaries. Say the game production cost $100 million, marketing $80 million and staff salaries $20 million. That is what they call an investment and evidently the investment has paid off.

I wanted to make this post cause it seems ridiculous that for however long this has been going on, they've had little to no change in viability outside of their majorly agreed niche: Mei as an off-tank, Sombra as an off-support, and Symmetra as a defense hero. History of The TrifectaFor an entire year, Mei has been considered ""F-tier"" since her niche only functions either stall a point at the end of overtime, or to slow enemies that have no movement or protection abilities of any kind: Zenyatta, Roadhog, Ana, Bastion, Torjborn, McCree (kindof). That's only 6 heroes that don't have any real capacity to evade her freeze, and the ones that don't have some sort of damage output to make it hard to even Mei to freeze said heroes. It is especially bad when her only form of range is a projectile that is in fact the ONLY projectile subjected to fall off damage. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwC6QVpn8MkAfter the Ana issue with her becoming the new OP and Must-Pick, the developers have become wary of any incident like that happening again when releasing a new hero. As such, Sombra had the most underwhelming reveal and hasn't moved in popularity and winrate for her entire existence since. Not to mention the fact that she has - and still is - riddled with bugs that detriment her kit overall with so many ability delays and has a ridiculously large spread in her primary that can't compete with other DPS like Soldier or Tracer. Symmetra long ago had the unique mechanic of Photon Shield, which gave allies permanent shield health until the targeted ally died, this was toned down immensely since it meant heroes with 150hp at the time like Tracer, Genji, and Zenyatta were able to benefit from Sym overall. While Symmetra wasn't considered OP, she was a bi-product of a combo that was considered OP. It was at this point that they flat out changed it to an ultimate and filled the Ability slot for Photon Barrier, which not only has a niche usage, but can' really compare to the original strength of Photon Shield. Even then and now, you can't really consider Symmetra over any healer since they have better utility overall. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdirotiA9hshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7n-1sEoZHQUPosted by SilentStormThe Trifecta's design their downfallMei has a projectile fall off, intentionally making her horrible in far range where she lacks. Mei's Ice Wall intentionally is a troll ability by design since your team can't see through the wall which makes it a detriment to your team if they can't see what's going on. Comparing to Reaper, he has a CC immune ability that allows him to move for 3 seconds and is able to reload to have the upper hand; a Mei gets stuck in place, doesn't reload, and no protection to ward people from swarming your Cryofreeze. If they're not gonna add anything to it, they should at least decrease the cooldown. Sombra has a delay to go in and out of Stealth, incredibly weak threshold on her abilities, long as cooldown on Hack and Stealth to make her unable to actually be ready to use them, and a ridiculously large spread that makes her the worst in terms of reliable DPS. Not to mention the bug issue, you can't expect me to believe that Sombra is comparably reliable to a Soldier or Tracer. Symmetra's turret has a 1.4 casting time, 10 meter dmg range, 25% speed reduction that can stack, with a 10 second cooldown with each turret, all of which have 1 HP. First of all, no one finds it fun to have a turret nest at a choke or in a room, not the enemy, not even the Sym player as it is mind-numblingly boring to do so. Secondly, having all of your turrets nested around a choke hitting 1 person is easily 120 dps with a 150% speed reduction; IF all do hit without being destroyed, and that is a big IF, cause most tanks can easily take them out, and with the newly added Moira can easily destroy the nest without hassle with her Biotic Orb and Grasp. Thirdly, it takes 30 seconds to build 3 new turrets, that is the same cooldown as a Mercy Rez, I'm not here to believe that bringing back someone from the dead is as important as building 3 1HP turrets.Lastly, Torbjorn has a better utility with his singular turret since his have 150 instant health that can gain 150+ health and damage more with a constant range of 40 meters. And with her Photon Barrier, the shape of the shield only helps if you're moving forward in chokes, it doesn't protect you from the sides nor behind; it doesn't have a very strong purpose other than to protect quick ults or to protect yourself, but even then you have a ridiculously long cooldown of 10 seconds that supposed to move without any control; a lot can easily happen in under 10 seconds that would be hard to protect.To sum it up, I can't expect to believe something as unreliable as these abilities with a big cooldown would help my team and myself in any non-niche way.Developer Recognition and AcknowledgmentMei's megathread on page 69 got acknowledgement of the fact that the page is being monitored, but many can agree that waiting over 2 weeks for anything else than that is not enough. She also got acknowledgement from Reddit of a bug thread that they'll look into. https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759356748#post-1https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/7ko6mx/mei_bug_list_with_examples/While the Sombra megathread hasn't got an acknowledgement post, we at least got a post from the bug megathread (one that I and many others have helped with) with it only acknowledging what has been categorized as ""fixed"" and the open response of hearing all the issues that aren't actually fixed. 2 weeks later and we've pretty much disproved the fact that the bugs have gone away, they still riddle Sombra and we still wait for any response or acknowledgement. https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760826184?page=1https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759587944?page=1https://youtu.be/soqdrpbbS-Q?t=2m17sThe outlier here is that Symmetra's megathread that has over 200 pages with no recognition whatsoever with any blue post. None. Many people - including myself - suggesting ideas and concepts on how to fix her without Sym becoming OP, but even still, I've seen a Lucio thread that asked for his ult to be buffed with a blue post saying that he's fine the way he is; my question is where is that response for Symmetra? https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759380928?page=1https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759517867#post-14To sum it up simplyWe need a better response for all of us so we can know if our fight for our mains is worth fighting for. It's tiring to believe from the lack of responses that with over 310 pages in total have been been all for naught because none of this will be even be shown in the PTR, we don't know and it's frustrating. You have to show that you're not scared of us seeing change or improvement of our heroes without making them ""OP"" or ""must-pick"", just something..."

Overall, even GM players don't bother with her, because learning her kit, her abilities, how and when to use her, is a waste of time compared to learning an actually useful hero.Sure, there is going to be one dude who's the best Mei/Sombra/Symmetra around, and he's likely going to be in the top 500 somewhere, because he's extremely good at what he does. There's going to be ten times as many &lt;insert viable hero here&gt; mains being top500 as well, because some heroes are stronger/more efficient than others.If you want a comparison, there is going to be a martial artist somewhere who can kick your and my butt at the same time, with a hand behind his back. It doesn't mean that missing a hand and being outnumbered isn't an obvious handicap.Posted by SenomarWhat I'm trying to say is indeed Mei seriously needs her bugs to be fixed in order to be more consistent, but what is needed the most is you to pour hours learning how and when to play a hero rather than massives buffs you're talking about.Fixing a hero's bugs is the first step in balancing it, not the one and only thing to do to get perfect balance. If no hero in the game had any bugs, and Soldier dealt 200 damage per shot with no falloff, there would be something obviously wrong to balance.

She's easy to hit and can be, frozen, halt'd, concussive blasted, hooked, hacked, punched, boostered, booped, sleep darted and charged away from the target, cancelling the ability. It's a lot to deal with as the Mercy, not to mention avoiding flankers. Somehow it all comes down to the cool down and the lack of things to do if it were longer. Valkerie also makes people mad as you can fly so far you're hard to hit or even impossible to hit for many heroes. I don't have a solution to this but that's what I've understood so far."

People claiming that it will always make Mercy a must-have clearly missed the tank aka Ana meta.What killed Ana was Winston’s buff and the dive meta that followed.So I agree that resurrect could be balanced - it was.  The offensive options being op is why the meta began favoring high mobility and the ability to resurrect instagibbed allies.Having said that, old resurrect was a complaint for many, but really it was because it felt bad when it countered your efforts.  When a big resurrect had that impact, it generally meant the offense screwed up and blew all their ultimates.  Rather than accept that, they cried until it was removed.And hide and seek Mercy was usually a losing strategy.  Most good Mercy players didn’t hide, they avoided being caught in ultimates, while supporting their team 99% of the time.Ironically, I now find myself hiding far more than ever to avoid rip tires every 30 seconds, as there’s no other way to avoid it reliably."

You don't need to stay in range of your target, you regen health, you don't need to prioritize healing targets, and you don't have to position well because you can be anywhere as long as it's within LoS and heal someone.The new Mercy has replaced the old Lucio for me as the most boring healer.

Yes, he is strong now but has his fair share of counters as well. Simply adapting to him will render him useless. Sure, if you just stand at the chokepoint while he spams you, yeah he's OP.

The high damage output along with the war of attrition between junkrat and an enemy trying to break a choke, Junkrat will win every time.I finished a game on temple of anubis earlier and i'm sure the Junkrat player had about 4 ultimates in the span of 2 minutes. I'd increase the charge rate. In terms of base damage I don't really see the fuss, Pharah is a carbon copy just more rockets and better mobility. A decent hitscan should be able to take Junkrat out fast the problem is it's a team game and getting 1v1 is difficult so the misconception is he is OP when in reality the ultimate is the problem."

So its infuriating when a random grenade hits you from no where near the action because of spamming. That said 120 with no drop off is a joke, not even Pharah can manage that consistency and she doesnt even get rebounds. Plus the fact splash manages that damage also, is further bs. Especially now he gets double mines.Theres been a few games where my team is being smashed, just outright being out played and ive switched to JR and completely stalled their progress and manage multiple kills via fluke rather than intent. Further more ive turned the tide of that game and would likely win. I like him being viable but I also think he needs looking at because the spam nature is overkill."

And trust me people are getting away with it. How are they getting away with it? Well they can throw half of their games and try half of their games. This gives them a get out of an in-game ban card. Also they can just throw some games on one account and throw some games on another. As long as they don't get constantly reported every game.I mean think about it, who's going to report someone if they aren't being toxic and throwing the game, even though they threw their last game. I mean you don't know whether or not someone threw their last match, but even if you did are you going to report them for trying to win their current match?Also someone can just throw games on one account get a few reports, then leap to another account and throw some more games as long as they aren't a lot of reports within a certain time frame.It just really bothers me how someone can just throw a game because it's not their main account. I feel like if Blizzard only allowed one or two Overwatch accounts under the same IP we wouldn't see much of this issue.Imo I don't think you need 4,5,6,7,8,9, or 10 accounts to play Overwatch.

I bought the game on pc to escape this very problem. I never played an fps on pc ever on my entire life, and I am being constantly stomped on pc. But I know I will improve.One possible solution to consoles, at least to reduce the astounding number of smurfs, is to require a link to a battle.net account with a game purchased on it. Give an option to register your console disc to ONE AND ONLY ONE specific battlenet, or, if you bought it digitally,  to only that account once you link you psn/xbla account with a battle.net account. This way, you would need to buy the game again on consoles to be a smurf.Take Fortnite for example, Epic Games requires psn and xbla accounts to make and link to an Epic account, so they can control this kinda problem with no difficulties."

When you can and do significantly change rank on a smurf vs your main account its no surprise theres a massive increase in smurfs. They did it for season 2 and not again since which is stupid. I dont know another game (please, let me know) that doesnt reset each season and starts you from where you left off minus a 100+sr.While I do like this idea, not everyone would like if they had to start all over.But to me this sounds like a great solution.True, itll likely upset a few people but like I said, I dont know a game that doesnt do a reset, when other major games do I dont get why OW doesnt. Plus those that get really upset over it would likely be those that are likely carried and riding past season highs, as to paraphrase an argument thrown around alot ""if youre good, youll climb"" thus if youre a good player, youll get a good rank. A hard reset would have a !@#$show in MM, whilst a soft would maintain MM in that you should be placing against people of the same level from last season and losses will have you face lower ranks and wins would have you facing higher ranks etc. Point being, as it stands seasons are irrelevant and serve no purpose other than to give the devs some maintenance time or whatever hence theyre like 2-3 days gap between seasons. Sort seasons out and I bet youll see less smurfs."

I suck with him.Look at the characters that have an advantage in a fight with Genji.-Mcree-Soldier-Winston-Pharah-Moira-Tracer-Zarya-Doomfist (once ALL his bugs are fixed)-JunkratThat's a decent amount of the cast. For some reason people will argue they don't have an advantage which still baffles me. Mcree is a good example.Deflect doesn't give Genji the advantage here. It can't when the Genji doesn't have the ride of way here. Mcree doesn't have to Flashbang until after Deflect is used. If he doesn't Deflect then you will just kill him. Baiting the Deflect with Mcree is super easy. You can by landing one shot on him which usually forces the Deflect or Melee to fake the Flashbang. You can even flash above or at his feet and be successful. If you get a Flashbang deflected back in your face it's almost always your fault.So I don't understand it.People like to say if he is good enough he has no counters. That's an outlier. I'm a Hanzo main. I have no counters at all if I'm on my game. That doesn't make Hanzo OP.

Most fights with Genji at lower ranks is when he is jumping around throwing stars at you. When he is just jumping around he is super predictable to land shots on.

First off. Junkrats mines. Genji can deflect but still take the full damage by air bursting it before it reaches him. A mind deflected back at you is a user error. Junkrats trap is great against flankers including Genji. It's a great way to shut them down especially if they are targeting certain heroes like healers. Put the trap in the back line where the healers hang out and you can trap Genji back there pretty consistently. Same for Tracer. The mines are the real reason though.

If they are better than you it's not by that much. What makes Genji unkillable? Tracer is far more difficult to kill than Genji. I pick Hanzo to counter Tracer at my rank because it's a skill match up. With Genji though, you can pick characters that can greatly put the odds in your favor."

I mean it's not like he should be scared of losing Top 500 on his main anyways. He may as well earn it since he can. I believe multiple Top 500 accounts per person shouldn't be a thing and that only one account should compete for a slot. I also believe big streamers like Calvin should be made an example of for calling people who complain about this ""retards."" He represents the game as much as the pros do. He's the one who partnered up with Twitch and decided to represent Overwatch. There for he should represent the game instead of staining its name.

With competitive rewards Blizzard did a great job specifying, before the mode was even added, that Competitive Player Icons and sprays would always be limited time, forever missable items. They are consistent and self explanatory. It's hard to confuse that an icon or spray aptly named 'Season 5 Contender' will ever be available again. A simple icon named Red Envelope, though? Or one named 2017? No indication in their names, images, or tooltip that they will be removed from next year's loot boxes. Prior to clicking this thread, I'm sure very few people even considered that the Red Envelope icon was already removed. But it probably is. That shows how inconsistent these removed icons are in comparison to the competitive rewards."

Bragging is neither here nor there. I've always been fine with permanently missable collectors items; it's Blizzard's approach that I find strange this time around. Blizzard likes to showcase how transparent they are with their community, and they usually are, but removing items from loot boxes without so much as mentioning it in the patch notes I find meaner than the usual Blizzard status quo.Plus the removed player icons in question were implemented before the Lootbox recoding earlier this year. One could have played every day of Winter Wonderland and Chinese New Year and never got either icon. There's nothing wrong with tough luck.

Opening 10 or so boxes every event isn't going to do much for you.^And like they said: If you play enough to earn at least 14 loot boxes you have a chance to get one legendary. I know it doesn't seem like much but the higher level you get and the more time you've spent on the game the easier it gets.

Or Gilbert Godfrey who got fired over his comments over the Tsunami. When you're a public figure of an organization, people expect you to know how to act.

But people kind of hate on him just because.1. He has gone through the worst and the best of overwatch. I think we all know that XQC is always the person to get [removed] over by overwatch. Disconnects, bugs, really BS hitboxes and stupid rein shatters. Don't get mad at him for calling the game [removed] after he's experienced so many of these bugs.2. He says hes changing. Look, you don't turn from toxic to good overnight. Nowadays, he isn't as toxic as before. He also isn't being toxic to be mean either. He does it because its his personality and for his stream.3. People just think of XQC as this sorry toxic excuse for a canadian, and thats just crazy. Maybe before this was true, but he listened to the community and his personality is definetly less toxic than before. People think hes ruining the community and should be the next Dafran. All im saying is, look at things from his point of view, and give him a chance. Hes changed from the suspensions hes got.

He isn’t exactly a role model for the community, but I do feel that quite a lot of the hate isn’t justified - it’s people jumping on the bandwagon; seeing clips of him being toxic or that one clip of him throwing and people hear others opinions and straight away think “He’s a di*k!

It’s just his character when he’s streaming, his pro teammates even say that he isn’t toxic, loud or hyper when playing serious and off camera, he’s an awesome dude apparently.

I will admit, that I am not completely innocent in the issue. I don't try to start any, but my response to toxicity isn't always the best. xQc to me is a child. He is very toxic, in team chat and when he gets fed up he's been reported to throw. He's given out false reports because he doesn't like how people play, and the one time I watched his stream to see just how bad he was, he was seen yelling at his team to  do what he wanted, and they still lost the point. He then went to call out a teammate who, from my observation was actually trying, for throwing. Now I am not T500, nor do I even play comp that much (I only have 68 hours in it compared to almost 800 in quick). I am a casual player, but I am a support main so looking at everything at once is just what I do, and xQc is good, but he is a very self-centered player. I can say, that toxicity only breeds more toxicity. Yelling quickly in the microphone because something isn't going his way, brings the entire team down, everyone gets just as fed up as he does, and could end with people just muting him completely. I can say, that if I was on his team I'd mute him. I can't stand people back-seat playing my character. Still, a ""Don't worry we got this next round"" helps team moral a lot more than yelling."

However this is not always the case since relying on the ability to land headshots on a Tracer will eventually fail you. Tracer is simply that overpowered in the current state of the gameAs for Genji, he just has way to many ways to escape from Mei. The slow projectile speed of Mei's primary fire makes it a nightmare to actually connect and freeze him when he's spamming double jump, and on top of that, Genji has his dash which takes him well out of range of Mei, while also going in any direction the Genji chooses.

I'd provide a link to the video proof but apparently that's against the law.I understand how you feel, I understand that it feels like you are being put up against people who are far better at the game then you are. I promise you that is not true, believe me I felt the same way when I first started, but it does get better.Another thing I would like to mention is that often times it is not your lack of skill or the lack of skill of each player on your team, but the lack of teamwork and cooperation between each player on the team. It is also worth mentioning that trying to force players to cooperate or trying to force a good team composition will never help, it will only make things worse and make the teamwork and cooperation decay faster.So just remember to be polite, try to be as kind as possible to your team, even if they do not return that kindness. Every little bit you can do to show your team that you are willing to cooperate helps, and every little bit of that make things get easier.Also, I am not sure about it being against the law to share video proof of something like this. You are allowed to give sources to help move along your discussion, so I do not see why this is any different. I could be wrong though, and by all means do not link to a video based on what I have said, if the Code of Conduct on the forums forbids it then please do not go against that."

The concept of placements statistically is to correct misjudgements by the system. More precisely, you start in your previous season SR initially, but there's more uncertainty i.e. SR volatility. As you do your placements, the system tries to determine your most suited SR and as the placements pass, the system becomes more certain. In other words, there's a different outcome of losing 4 and then winning 6, with winning 4, losing 2, winning 2 and then losing 2.

I wish they would revert or rebuff the radius of the grenade. Sometimes when playing Ana and I'm trying to sustain a group of people I feel like the grenade does hit the amount of targets it should , I usually only hit 2 people with it and the group are not even that far apart. The damage buff was cool but I would take that back for a radius buff. As long as they keep the healing the same so is doesn't encourage the tank meta again it should be fine I believe. If you disagree,tell me why but you don't have to be rude about it."
2760,https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760756795,Ana's Grenade,NA,I'm neutral about the grenade. Personally I think the sleep dart's a terrible self-defense tool. It might be a great ULT counter but put two flankers in the field and Ana's pretty much hard countered. If you sleep one then his brother will kill you. Guardian-Anger is so much a better self defense than she has. I wish she had something better to evade with than a wonky dart on a long cool down.

Currently, we have four heroes/characters that are associated with Blackwatch, right? Reaper, McCree, Genji and Moira. What I'm thinking is that maybe, just maybe, we might be getting a new PVE based on these four characters. But this is just my thoughts and it'd kinda make logical sense when you come to think about it.In Moira's origin story, we're gifted with bits of information that relate to her experiments, mainly one that presents Gabriel Reyes looking at himself in awe while black-like smoke slither off his body, perhaps displaying his ability to wraith and shadow step. This would explain his power without relating to the fact that he got them when he died. Imagine it, Reaper, McCree, Genji and Moira in their Blackwatch related skins fighting off Omnics or any other type of enemy, just like in the Uprising mode. Now the biggest concern with this is that there's three offence heroes and one healer. In Uprising, we had the choice of one of each role. Tracer, Torbjörn, Reinhardt and Mercy. Now I can only assume that the map layout and game-mode will function through teamwork while causing havoc. Also, think of the interactions and the witty banter they'll share with each other.Obviously, I can't confirm nothing, this was just a thought that I had in mind of what might come in the future.

This was originally done to fix bugs on a couple heroes, but the changes are systemic and affect all Heroes.   Specifically, movement on the ground is much more consistent. Going up/down inclines will no longer affect the Hero’s speed.  Previously, inclines could either make you move slightly faster or slightly slower, depending on the circumstances. Inclines will also no longer cause a small amount of strafing movement when moving diagonally on them.   A side effect of these changes is characters will now have slightly better air control.   For example, Winston previously was not able to easily make small adjustments to his flight path during his Jump Pack leap, but now he should be able to do that, and it is also noticeable on many of the other Heroes that are often in the air.We think these changes will overall be great improvements but there might be some unintended side effects that we’d love your help finding on the PTR!Thanks!"

2880,https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760766812,Support Self-Healing Unfairness,12/22/2017 6:54,"I've always wondered this, and am now adding it into my thoughts with Moira about all the supports' self-healing abilities. This is excluding ultimates.Mercy heals 20hp/s after a one-second buffer.Moira heals through damaging, at 33hp/s, or with her 10-second CD orb that does 75hp/s for a maximum of 300 HP healed in total/heals any ally near it who is damaged.Lucio heals for 12hp/s only with the correct song which has a .8-second CD to swap between the two, and does 35hp/s for three seconds on a 12-second CD.Zenyatta heals 30 shields/second after not taking damage for three seconds. This cannot heal his 50 hp, only his 150 shields.Ana can only heal herself with her grenade that has a 10-second CD, and it heals 100hp for anyone within the radius of it, but also damages enemies, buffs healing recieved for all allied targets and prevents enemies from receiving any form of healing for four seconds.Symmetra has less shields than Zenyatta, with 100, only able to heal 30hp/s after not getting hit for three seconds._____Now, I'm wondering this: why does Mercy ( and now Moira ) have such overpowered self-healing compared to the other supports? I'm probably one of the only people that want Moira's self-healing through her damage nerfed ( preferably halved, that way it's between Mercy and shields in some sense ), Mercy's self-healing nerfed ( and not work how it does in her ult, just keep it the same normally ), and Ana, Zenyatta and Lucio's self-healing buffed.I suggest that Mercy's self healing change to two second wait time for 10 or 15hp/s ( and not always heal during her ult ). People argue that ""she's a support, she has no defense by herself and needs it"". This is false. She has a gun, she has teammates. Just because she's in a solo situation by herself does not automatically mean she's allowed to have the most powerful healing in the game. Put anyone else in that situation. They work out just fine, and so can Mercy, but she has more self-healing instead of damage, despite her damage still being pretty decent.Preferably I'd like Ana to have something similar to Mercy's self-healing, but on a nerfed scale, and her grenade's healing and damage nerfed a bit, but keep the cooldown the same. Ana has self-healing on a ten-second cooldown, and she must choose to either use it on herself, an enemy, or her teammates. This is ridiculous.Lucio's self-healing is a constant passive so long as he has his healing up and not his speed boost. He doesn't even get healed for as much as he can heal others, and I have to wonder why this is.Moira should not heal for as much as she does. ""Requiring aim for her to heal"" is not a trade-off argument in this situation, because she HAS to aim in order to get her primary ally healing back. With a little bit of practice it seems anyone can play her pretty well; she's easy to pick up and is a main healer like Mercy, but with much more damage and self-healing. Her orb is fine in my opinion because she, like Ana, has to choose on damage or healing, but this, too, can be sucked up by D.Va or reflected by Genji, but at least she can just automatically start sucking the life out of enemies for her own self-healing, and on a massive scale. She's barely a support, she's basically just a hybrid of Soldier and Symmetra with Zenyatta's shtick of harmony/discord and orbs. I'm probably one of the only people that want her nerfed.Zenyatta and Symmetra are a different matter entirely. Neither of them can fully heal themselves, and must wait three seconds without being hit to even start the process. You get hit? Good luck, another three seconds. They have no mobility. Zenyatta has it even less than Symmetra does in some sense because Symmetra has a shield ability she can throw out, and her turrets for some protection, but Zen does not. There's clear differences between the two and that's damage and support ability; Symmetra buffs teams, Zenyatta debuffs enemies. Their damage is similar, but Zen without his orb does more, has range, but is projectile VS Symmetra's ( knowingly-bugged ) lock-on beam that cannot be reflected or headshot. The pair need something that isn't shields for self-healing. It would feel wrong giving both of them something that isn't shields in my opinion; Zen could have an auto-repair thing like Bastion does, and Symmetra could just have self-healing like Mercy, but still give shields with her ult. Hell, you could even let Zenyatta orb himself, but then that'd be a similar situation to Ana: self or ally.Just my quickly thought-up two cents.TL;DR- Nerf Moira and Mercy self-healing.- Give Ana and Symmetra similar regen qualities like Mercy and remove Symmetra's starting shields in favor of just pure HP.- Have Lucio's self-healing buffed.- Remove Zenyatta's shields and add pure HP, and give him a self-repair like Bastion, or let him orb himself."
2881,https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760766812,Support Self-Healing Unfairness,NA,"Let me just lay it down as it is.Yes, Mercy gets full hp after 11 seconds of staying out of combat if she has 1hp left, but it is interupted by any and all damage. Let's not forget it takes a whole second to heal 20hp, it's only 1 hp more than a 76 bullet. Provided you can shoot her every second she won't regenerate hp.Yes, Moira get 33 hp/s, but literally any dps worth their salt can kill her faster than she can regenerate. If she has her Orb up. Retreat, swallow your pride and fall back. Don't want her to regen hp? Attack from behind a shield, she'll either have to get past the shield, waste her orb or run. And she can't take 2 people on at once alone.Yes, Ana gets 100 hp/nade and the nade takes 10 seconds to cooldown. BUT the nade is a game changing ability as it can block all healing for 3 seconds. (except shield regen)  and can deny Life saving healing and can add a 1.5* multiplier to allied healing which is huge. If she didn't have to use it to heal herself, the effect would be staggering.Zenyatta has shields as He's a combat/dps hybrid along with Moira. Both have 30hp/s healing as they're expected to dip in and out  of combat frequently having toned down healing would lower his uptimes as he's already slow and very weak to dive.Lucio has weak healing as he has plenty of other tools to escape his enemies. He can speed away after booping enemies and wallriding further increases his ability to escape. Compare and contrast to Moira who only has 1 fade on a 6 second CD and almost every DPS has a way of keeping up with her should they decide to give chase but has a stronger 33hp/s healing to compensate.Lastly there's Symmetra. She's nothing special, not a trained war veteran, doesn't have any special healing technology to patch her up. Her Shields and Light constructs are all she has. Removing her shield hp and replacing it with normal hp would not only change a large part if the character it would also make her less susceptible to sombra's EMP, which counters a dispropotionately large part of her kit already as though they designed Sombra to counter Symmetra."

I agree that at gold and below her skill floor allows her to 1v1 easier, but in plat any dps can kill her easily. Her orb needs to not focus syms turrents, that's it.I don't think OP supports that Moira is OP in 1v1, in comparison with other supports. Moira along with an out of cds Ana need the most time to duel as a flanker. However, Ana needs her cooldowns to duel, while Moira not; In tight maps, like the controls, it's almost impossible to kill her (given that her team has awareness). She just needs a tremendous time to be killed, so she doesn't worth the time. It's better to kill fast other key targets like junkrat (for the shields), the second healer etc. Second she is the only support that can cheat death from dedicated flanker (Tracer and Genji) ulties with her teleport.IMO, Moira will be nerfed for sure, no matter how much we argue in favour or against her. The reason is simple; her competitive winning rates are just too high for a new hero and she has unreal average stats (combo of high elims, final blows, healing and low deaths). She is 4th (platinum stats) in Eliminations over Deaths ratio behind from D.Va, Torb and Zarya. DVa and Torb were always in the E:D first places due to their mechanics and survability.After examining the stats I wonder: Should a support have a place there? As you already know there are a lot of topics about Genji's and Tracer's survivability, but Moira is in a better position right now.There are a lot of people around who believe that Moira is fine. Can you support your arguments through statistics? Stats are objective facts, while ""a Tracer can kill Moira"" is very subjective, because this is a 6v6 game and not a 1v1 deathmatch. In papers, Tracer deals exactly 400 dmg with 1 clip if she only headshots. Have you ever seen a double kill against 2 full health dps with 1 clip? That's why stats matter."

Self healing is not the only factor in survivability. Keep in mind, Symmetra and Zennyatta have significantly more damage the the others. Becoming quasi-DPS at times. A spatially aware Zennyata with decent aim can RMB one shot characters chasing them down, especially around corners and chokes. Meanwhile Symmetra's laser does a significant amount of damage, on top of her area denial with turrets, killing the Symmetra is not always as easy as you might think. Their self defense capabilities I think make up for their lower sustained healing. Also, Ana has her sleep dart. If she is getting dived or harassed, you can just sleep them. Yes, she has less self healing, but her shutdown potential makes up for that in my opinion. Also, Moira has to get very close to the enemy for her self healing, often that can be very risky, if the enemy team is dive heavy. For instance, yes your regenerating 33 hp/s, which is quite good. But if you have a Tracer diving you, you'll still die in a couple seconds, if that. That said, mercy's self heal seems a bit copious comparatively. Perhaps make it 2 seconds before it starts?

And I was on track to get higher until my good laptop broke.People say ""communication is everything"" but in my experience you don't need to talk to coordinate. You can tell when they're going in, when big ults are about to happen, etc etc. As long as you are playing your hero well, everything should fall into place generally speaking. Will you win every match? No. But you don't with voice chat either, the difference here is you don't have 5 people blaming you when you lose.I agree with you so much. I give everyone the beginning chance of being respectful and not complete douches. Sadly, they fail at it often in chat.  The report function is your friend...   but then they interfere with trying to concentrate and have fun- they change the experience on my end... so I silence them... SO much better.  In reality, they are complete strangers who do no mean a thing. I do not NEED to listen to their toxicity - there is always a choice. Redhood- below: I am glad you had good experiences... sadly its not the case for many of us.  I will say this... I played with a team where most of the males were probably 12 or 13 today and maybe one male was their Dad (guessing but could be wrong)... They were more respectful than 90% of the males I have witnessed ingame. That is pretty sad.  Adult males or even post pubescent males should know better. Do they want their Moms or sister treated this way? Then why do it to others. Manners and some kind of vales system would be nice."

Well if Winston hard counters Genji, he ultra hard ultimate counters Sym, since he can basically obliterate her and her constructs at will, and needs serious misplay to lose against her.It's kinda true that in term of characters able to keep Genji in check, he's likely the most competent, and will force him at minimum to either stay at range, be careful with his cooldowns, or very confident that he can take down someone fast enough to get a dash reset before he's in trouble. To compare with other beam chars, like Zar, Mei, or Sym, he just has to not get close to them, and since they have no mobility, it's not a hard task .Edit: forgot Moira, who very likely does a nice job of defending herself against Genji (who naturally targets healers), and whose strong heals might help allies against his burst (maybe). Her orbs are also perfect for the times he's backing off into a building, although whether or not wasting a cooldown to maybe get him is another choice to make."

Even for Winston, Genji's hardest counter, neither is true. Instead, for him (and Tracer) the definition is amended. ""You're not supposed to kill him. Just annoy him into backing away for a few seconds."" Winston can make Genjis job harder, but a good Genji certainly doesn't have to switch. He still has more mobility options than Winston. He has better range than Winston.  And once Genji has his ult (which he can build by peppering Winston from afar), Winston isn't even a threat unless he has his ult (which he probably won't if all he's doing is babysitting the back line from Genji).Basically, Winston is Genji's hardest counter, but he's certainly not a hard counter, at least not as the term applies to other characters."

If its defense then you shouldn't be diving a lot of the time.Winston jump CD is shorter than genji dash, also most winstons don't waste their jump needlessly. If the genji is an idiot enough to dash into your team you jump on him and you will have jump before he has dash and should be an easy pick. If he tries walking to your team so can you and you should be closer to your team anyway, case of wasting dash. You have a shield, that stops his ult charging. If you aren't diving you should have this up.A lot of people here think that you have to be killing genji as winston... you don't. If he's not a actual threat then don't go for the kill, if he's gone and !@#$ed off with enough health to duel you or is getting healed you shouldn't be chasing him., you've already done enough protecting your team and stopping a burst kill.

You're assuming that all people beyond yourself have an equally likely chance of leaving a game, and that only one person will leave the game during its match. This in and of itself is flawed logic as anyone who has ever been in a match with a leaver knows that other people can also leave during the match. However, let's ignore that. Your supposition is that for every leaving match there are 11 members who might leave. 6 out of those 11 members on the opposing team. 5 out of those 11 on your team. Or (because you were not kind enough to calculate your own proofs) there is a 54.5% chance of the leaver being on the opposite team and a 45.5% chance of that leaver being on your team. (Those are good odds for a casino, bad odds for just about anything else.)Of course,  your argument also hinges on the belief that oneself will never be the leaver. This is statistically dodgy at best as, should you lose power or connection, you yourself will be the leaver. This makes it back to 50% chance you will be on the leaving team. You cannot discount yourself from a calculation because there is a chance, no matter how slim, that you will be the leaver. And each person similarly has a different chance they will leave a game - whether through a statistically worse internet connection or a habit of leaving. In reality, the odds of you having a leaver on your team would be calculated by each player's individual leaving percentage times the 1/12 chance they will be placed on your team versus another.

""It doesn't translate into the real world that well."" That is why. I duo queue, so according to his ""math"" I have an even less likely chance of encountering leavers on my team. However, in my experience this season, I have encountered more ""leavers"" on my team. If you consider that most of them returned and were therefore disconnects, I have encountered an equal amount of leavers. That does not add up in the most basic of examples weighed in his favor. That is why people dislike it, it is literally a waste of time even humoring this conclusion that weights exactly one variable. If you pass your opinion off as fact and hide behind a technicality, that is what happens and I am surprised so many sheep actually agree with this juvenile reasoning. People who are not privy to ""ooh, that is technically true"" are going to call out the fallacy because it is not true. There are literally hundreds upon thousands of variables to consider at the end of the day. Ending the story at, ""you are not going to leave, so that means they might be more likely to leave"" is erroneous af.Beyond that, let us go into the delusional mind of a Junkrat main and for one second pretend that this drivel is actually objective fact. In this fantasy land where 2 + 2 = 6 and this guy confirmed the math, so it must be true, leavers are more likely on the enemy team. And that leaves us with a big so what? Who cares? That is not going to make me feel better when my wins and losses are invalidated because someone left. Free win, free loss, it does not matter. In the case of a free win, I get 15 out of 3000 competitive points and in the case of the free loss, I go down in SR and wait until they get a leaver to bring it back up to neutral. My point is that his, um... observation (I am tired of alluding to this half-baked assumption as math) means nothing. It is of no concern to anyone and most people could deduce this general guideline for themselves. That could be another logical reason for down-votes. It is not even worth considering."

As it stands most heroes once you get into range with them, they are easily frozen. Getting in range and surviving the enemy team is the difficult part. So extending the time the slow debuff last will have an impact on Tracer and Genji who usually get exposed but swift strike/blink out but everyone else's match up will remain the same."

I screencap everytime this happens, I actually might just start making a folder of frozen tracers. (Or just tracer suffering)When it comes to tracer, I'm obviously relying on my icicle. As I've honed my aim well, I tend to atleast body shot them and force a recall. The really, really good tracers (the gm and top 500 ones I'm currently facing) I've just started playing against... yeah I'm struggling hitting them with MCREE (my other main) lmao.Good tracers are scary, and Mei is inconsistent for tracer even if you've greatly honed your aim. Some games I never hit tracer, while others I'm always headshotting them! They usually switch to pharah and focus me, I still shoot them down tho.Now, as for buffs, people have the absolute wrong idea for Mei I feel. IN FACT most of these suggestions come from people who dont even play Mei or realize her true role, or why Mei isnt the most ideal pick.As buzzinate pointed out, mobility skills should be reduced in terms of speed and distance, not completely removed that's basically hacking your enemy with primary fire. That would make Mei way too good, and then people will bandwagon her, yeah no thanks, don't want my Mei being a mustpick. I prefer the confined community that is being a Mei main. Now, Mei is weighed down due to the heavy gear she wears,  I understand that but I feel her speed could be increased just a bit, for QOL. Nothing major.  Really, Mei just needs minor-median QOL changes, nothing as severe as a rework please. A new ability maybe? Ultimate buffs definetly. Overall Mei just needs the small things, such as primary fire becoming hitscan (literally every other beam is). Icicles should stay the same besides an increased rate of fire. Cyrofreeze could be changed to stall less, but be more efficient such as providing a reload. I HATE people who pick Mei just to stall an inevitable loss, by the way her winrate is negatively impacted by this since people tend to go over that stat often.Mei doesn't need much to be in a better spot, people who suck as mei will still suck. Good meis can enjoy a better experience, and new people should be more welcomed to try out mei. Simple.NOW, as for HARD changes sym is what truly needs looking at, and I say that as someone who hates sym with a passion and loves Mei more than anything else."

Probably discouraging. It's always kind of been this way too, except for when? When Mercy would hide, pop off a huge Rez, and now she was on fire. Psychologically... it feels good.

Brain dead. M1M1M1M1M1. Rez bot. Pathetic. Boosted. Yes. I can't say these words don't hurt, because they do. However, playing Mercy gives me passion. Some may not understand it; I don't exactly expect you to! Everyone is different and connects with varying heroes. ^^ So, let me just talk about Mercy before her re-work.Sure. Hiding wasn't as fun...and fighting a Mercy who just hid, flew in, revived everyone wasn't fun either. What was though, was the intensity to gather enough charge for revive, constantly feeling on edge, healing everyone, damage boosting every ability to get your ult quickly. It made healing more enjoyable. Sometimes, we got POTG too, not always, but sometimes. It was nice...for at least one shining moment a support's love and work for the team was shown.I used to hear in the voice comms wonderful comments whenever I pulled of a big revive, and if not, my heart gleamed with satisfaction whenever I chose correct to do a 1 man...or save for 3-5! However...the Mercy rework has come.The intentions were perfectly fine. Though, all in all...it wasn't done well. When she first got it, I admit fully that she was so broken. Instant revive...then Valkyrie with it resetting, then on 10 second cd? Insane it felt! Then, they nerfed her...and nerfed her...to the state she is now in.I have not played Overwatch in a few weeks, for my lovely hero who I felt a connection with had changed, and my bond with her was then tearing apart. The slow revive...it is not fun. It really isn't. It feels like a drag to revive someone, and usually you can only do it when the enemy team is nearly all dead. Her ultimate...I feel as though I need to get it quickly, as before! However...I don't look forward to it as I used to. I know that I can do plenty with it...but it just doesn't feel fun. It's hard to hit her flying around...her GA is so far...her beam range just isn't Mercy. Then soaring in the revive comrades who have fallen on the ground in combat, up to only 2, then flying back up. Sounds incredible...but doing it is lackluster. There is no adrenaline. There is no smile adorning my face. It feels like I am just a bot now...as though the names I was called before were true. Now...when I look at the big picture, people still think Mercy is the best support. She was fine for what..2 years? 3? with her 5 man revive (at max). Now being able to revive only one every 30 seconds...having to stand still for nearly 2 which makes one an easy target...that is op as well? My eyes turn to the side when I play her. I don't get enjoyment as I used to. I look towards other heroes because it's not fun to play Mercy. I have had a love for supporting people...healing, reviving them, boosting damage, and being able to fly...those are all incredible. And for those wonderful gifts to feel no longer pleasent to fight with is a true shame.She was the reason I bought Overwatch...I guess she's also the reason I am now drifting away.TLDR; New Mercy is no longer fun. She feels like broken scraps torn up."

Valkyrie isn't very much interesting simply due to the fact that you're MERCY. If you don't play Mercy as Intended...Valkyrie can be quite fun. You got Super mobility, infinite Ammo, and you have free reign over the skybox! Too bad you don't really get to use much of it...Old Rez was also super refreshing. Before it felt special because it was a break from your normal play as Mercy. You made a super huge play that could end up saving an entire team fight! The person who just sits back and heals! It was a 2nd wind my team and I could definitely use in most games. It was AMAZING the effect it had. Just hearing everyone in chat go NUTS over how important it was. Even if we lost the teamfight again...people would be like ""that was a great rez Mercy"" and I would too! Now it's kinda like...a chore. Something that's expected to happen every 30 seconds. It has impact but it never really FEELS impactful like the last one. &gt;.&gt; That's my take on this anyway. Yes! This explains it very well, haha. Though I find other parts of her...the intensity and meanfulness of being alive! Feeling proud of how fast you got revive! I wish I had to earn it...instead of being given it. It's like how DPS earn their kills. I want to earn my spot on the team, not just by healing, (which I earn by being aware, and swapping targets, predicting who will get damaged etc) but by using her special mechanic...reviving &lt;3"

Nothing. I don’t die every thirty seconds because I have good game sense. I beat a MOIRA in heals. That’s saying a lot. I would love to play Anna I enjoy her more But what if you have the more healing did you  win the game ? Did you save the game at last minute with your double rez when in valkry form she can escape enemy ults for 20 secs Anna wont be around a lot like Mercy she cant fly around to others and escape death many times  don't blame I am saying what i have experienced in the game and in this bull!@#$ meta that requires mercy all the time cuz of her outstanding kit you know i love Lucio and I stopped playing comp cuz everyone keep asking to switch off to Mercy but if go to comp i will have to switch at some point not playing the hero that I actually enjoy and see my chances with There is nothing wrong with Anna at all but you have to play around the meta its competing after all we should compete with the best picks and I don't like what I said but its what i see I myself play Tanks(d.va-monkey) i will say damn Anna missed her shot but Mercy would follow around with one click pocketing forever even from a coveri had once to switch off Anna to Mercy I was able to keep the team a life and healed longer than I was with Anna even if I healed the same amount so why blizzard wont think about a way to Anna to survive like giving her a hook like widow she is a sniper but she cant reach high places fast anyway i don't say that you have to switch when told to you don't have to do that at all its sad thing what I said I don't like the game like thisThe balances in healers make a different in a competitive game

But now people literally rage if you aren't constantly following them around and holding down left click on them, it's really sad how the easiest support to play is the strongest and how pocketing has become the standard as opposed to being able to do anything else with a support that's actually enjoyable for the player to do.Hopefully they'll nerf her for season 8 and we can move on to crying about Moira.

So since Mercy's rework, i feel like she has become way too relevant, which has lead to some serious nerfs. I feel like after 300 hours of Mercy (both non-reworked and reworked) that Blizzard could have went with a different approach to Mercy instead of Valkyrie. So here's a list of changes i think is still not too late to do as some people isn't pleased with Valkyrie. I would love to hear people's opinions on this! Anyway, here we go;• Change Valkyrie back to old Ressurrect  - Keep new mercy GA ""angel jump"" - Give res a resource meter   - When mercy gets her ult, the resource meter will be at 5 ( max charge; indicates how many resses)This will make it possible to res your whole team within the time frameWithin 5 seconds, the resource meter depletes to 0 instantly. From there you can increase the charge by healing / damage boosting / doing damage / selfhealing. Table for charge needed for various res charges: 1 man res: 100 charge 2 man res: 200 charges3 man res: 300 charges4 man res: 400 charges5 man res: 500 chargesNow, obviously these numbers can change to range from 10 to 1000, completely up to Blizzard.Now you might ask about the whole ""hide and res"" ordeal which is what made Blizzard rework Mercy in the first place. Here's the idea; after 6 - 7 seconds of doing nothing (or hiding) the resource meter starts depleting very quickly (I feel like after 9 seconds the resource meter should be completely empty. Just like Moira's Biotic Energy lasts 9 seconds at full charge). This will prevent the ""hide and seek"" methods which every Mercy player used. When the meter starts depleting, you can still use Res from where the rate is. For example;If you're at charge 4 and the meter starts depleting to 3, if you Res before the charge hits 3, you will res 4 teammates. Now, any number or mechanic here can be changed to suit Blizzards taste, this is just a start."

3356,https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760806797,A character pitch,12/22/2017 23:45,"So we've only 3 characters the use Melee to deal most of their damage... Rien, Winston and Genji with their respective ults. I think we should get another! And I've got an idea! The idea for the kit would work like this:The primary would be some type of melee projectile, like a disk or glave that can bounce off of enemies and surfaces. Since not very many of the cast shoot actual solids (Torb and Genji are examples) I'm torn between whether it can be deflected or absorbed like those or be an actual melee weapon and cannot. I'm not sure about a secondary fire, as I planned for the disk to be charged like Hanzo to shoot it faster and do more damage. The first ability would be like a scatter arrow but act more like an explosion and would do all it's damage at once instead of separate fragments bouncing around.  10 second reload maybe? The second ability would be either a piercing shot or a shocking disk that slows and denies ability use for a second or two. The ult would be activated like the Supercharger. They place down a device that prevents critical hits to their teammates until a certain amount of damage is absorbed and then becomes inactive. It blocks the extra damage taken after the critical multiplier and ideally would show it's affected targets the amount of damage left over to be absorbed. I'm not sure what the ideal lockon distance would be but it certainly respects LoS and breaks after 1 second when you can't see it. This definitely needs work and refinement but I would like to see your guy's thoughts and certainly a response from the Team."

You are playing normaly, then you can't move while everyone else is moving normaly, not when you are lagging and everything stops. 2.) The screen goes black with the loading icon spinning, this will either, after 20-30 seconds rejoin you to the game(see 3A), or you get some yellow text in the chat saying ""Failed to connect to server""(see 3B).3A.) When the server rejoins you it acts like a brand new game, displaying the teams. Then you have to pick a hero, it wont display the one you were playing, it will pick a random one like in the start of a new game.3B.) You have to press Esc, then select ""Leave Match"", then on the main menu select ""Rejoin Match"", sometimes you have to press it multiple times for anything to happen. When you join the match the game acts like it's a brand new game like 3A (see above).Possible ways to recreate/causes for this bug(mostly random):- (DVA) Activating new mech after ulting, just after being booped into a wall.- (Kill cam) As soon as the kill cam starts, you can't exit it, then the server kicks you.This has been going on for several months, and it seems to happen a lot more since the last update."

Highest ive seen anywhere anytime is mercy at 20% in gold.Without condoning or condemning the point of this thread-I feel there may be some confusion in regard to pick rate stats on your part. When you look at over buff and you see a pick rate stat, be it 4%, 8%, 16%, etc- That doesn’t mean they’re showing up 4, 8, or 16% “of the time”- as in 4/8/16 times out of 100. It means they’re typically comprising 4/8/16/whatever of the hero SLOTS in a game. There are 12 slots in a game. 100/12=8.33. So any time you see someone at around 8%, that means they’re almost ALWAYS going to be in a game. But there’s two teams. When you see heros such as mercy pushing 16%, this means it’s because BOTH sides are almost always picking her."

Wraithing into a teleport or teleporting into a wraith is really clunky and usually a suicide when escaping or entering combat.I think we all know the biggest issue is ShadowStep. It's only used well to escape spawn and a very wide flank (like gaps on Hanamura or Volskaya)It has its uses, but abilities that don't work in a fight are just bad.Shadowstep is counter-intuitive for Reaper. It's the only ability that doesn't give you an advantage when you're already fighting.Honestly I think Shadowstep and Wraith need reworks. While Reaper is in a niche state and is considered the ""highest F tier"" I don't want him buffed to Junkrat levels.So what could we do? Remove Shadowstep and give Wraith slight vertical movement, like a short Pharah hover or a Wallclimb. Not anything absurdThen what would Reaper's other ability be? Smoke BombsThey would probably be binded to Alt-Fire to feel more natural.Smoke bombs would work perfectly. He can throw them and wraith away for a better escape rather than risking a teleport.The only OP scenario I can picture is SmokeBombing a Graviton Surge.But other than that, it wouldn't be too absurd to fight. Even if Reaper wanted to death blossom into smoke, everyone already wants to escape the smoke so running from beyblade isn't too big of an issue.Here's what I'm proposing:ShadowBombsReaper stops shooting, and quickly shoots 4 smoke bombs from his guns.Like Junkrat bombs, but heavier so they have less range. Start smoking on impact with a: shield, barrier, wall, or floor-Fired 2 at a time, rapid burst so you can't make huge smoke walls-Around a 12 second cooldown, maybe higher-Each bomb has a small radius, around 2-4 meters-Last around 4 seconds, just enough for a quick getaway or an entryWhile I have extemely high doubts of this ever being ingame. I think it would work very well for Reaper and could even make him more interesting for normal gameplay and even esports.I hope the dev's consider a Reaper change soon"

Most people do not react in .2-.3 seconds at all. Plus they have to notice first in order to react at all. Hack is an amazing ability and is what makes Sombra a good duelist actually. The only buff hack needs is the ability to affect passives. Mercy in Valk can be killed easier with no regen, Lucio can't stall without wall ride making him hard to hit, and Genji can't double jump or climb away from a fight. This would make Sombra the one true counter to mobility heroes and I think it would be a great buff.Weapon spread is horrible, but 30% is a bit much with how many shots she has. Id say 15% spread reduction will do since she can still do good dmg. We don't really need her to be a Tank buster on poor Zarya.For stealth, you are completely wrong. It not just lets you run fast, but you can stall an objective for a bit with people not noticing and you can pick off supports easily. (Especially Zenyatta!) Her having a delay isnt a bad thing and her having no delay was a bit too strong since it allowed her to assassinate healers without a trail. Yes she should be stealthy, be hard to track and assassinate easily. But she shouldn't have no counterplay or way of to be predicted.For your last argument: when a hero has an ult and is hacked, everyone can see it clear as day. Plus, you should be calling it out either way since Sombra is meant to be an enabler character. She's a cross of support and flanker making her unique. But in the end, she is a form of support by her kit's design and requires coordination and calling out. You shouldn't have your team see it so easily that you don't have to tell them your plan. Sombra shouldn't be a solo carry hero and should never be buffed to be one. She carries the weight of your team, not the match. You give your team an easy game and open opportunities for them. If you think Sombra should be played for a solo carry environment, then you don't understand her design and play her wrong or ask for too much. Aside from that, you have a few good points and I do believe Sombra needs a few buffs. But the kind to make her a better enabler, not the kind to make her the new Tracer."

But need to move from that single minded ideal of Sombra. We can do this by the following:1) Reduce spread so her DPS is more reliable2) Get a Hack reset every time she kills someone so she can Hack more often3) Stealth should become a resource meter to overall improve on consistency (not 100% on this)4) Every ability Sombra has SHOULD NOT have a delay5) Sugar Skulls on hacked enemies would make the world go round for Sombra6) Fix ALL SEVEN bugs that Sombra has so she can be at least functional"

Deflect hitboxes and fast movements and every other argument they bring up is just an excuse to request for either a hard counter that takes little to no effort but destroys genji, or to remove genji from competitive play.I've seen countless posts of people with 5 minutes of genji play in TOTAL, claiming that he's too easy to contribute with and to win. a lot of players never play him, yet consider him an EASY character to play which rewards you heavily. Like i said. The reason isn't logical.I don't want to lump myself with these kinds of people. I'm a Support main and I know full well when I've been outplayed and when a kill/death is deserved. As a Support main, I am fully aware of everything around me at all times. The problem that I have with Genji, at least as a Lucio main, is that his Deflect hitbox is far too large.

Moira: Requires slight aim to heal. Must figure out whether to use a healing/damage orb mid battle, and how to do consistent damage to maintain steady heals. I mean sure Mercy players have to be alert and have decent game sense but when you break it down to the basics she is just an all around easy hero to play and if you say otherwise I just might have to call you stupid. She easily has the best healing in the game with one of the easiest ways of outputting it.Good luck fixing that broken mechanic Blizzard."

Mercy might have a high pickrate at lower elo, but she is still manageable. Just revert Mercy back before her rework and you'll see her pickrate drop down. I feel like people forget what happened like 1 season ago. Mercy wasn't always 100% essential and I don't know why people exxagerate it as much. Yes, she rose but that was mainly because of Ana's nerf. With the addition of Moira and the buff back to Ana, 1.0 Mercy if brought back won't be nearly as much as an issue as this Mercy is now or even if she was an issue originally. There are better healers, she isn't 1 of 2 now and with the more variety in kit from Ana and Moira, it will really show.Me thinks that people over exaggerate her pick rates before rework, because she was picked the most of all healers 1-2 seasons ago.She was picked the most, and you'd usually run into the multiple ""Mercy OTP in a match"" issue, but no way in hell she was a must pick across all ranks. Maybe at lower ranks where players depended more on ults to win fights, since old rez could counter every ultimate the enemy could throw at you only if it was used at the last moment. Mass Rez was crazy, and Mercy eventually started to powercreep her way to high ranks thanks to the invulnerability buff letting Rez be used as an escape mechanism and as a method to force the pace of the match with tempo rezzes, but Ana, Lucio and Zen were also crazy."

Rez was suicide 90% of the time before invulnerability was added in February. It was finally ""acceptable"" to play Mercy, because her ult was no longer a death sentence. She wasn't considered viable up until that point, and after becoming viable, no one complained about her. No one complained about ""hide and rez"", either.Even with her invuln, Ana and Lucio (or was it Zenyatta?) were still favored over Mercy. Pre-rework Mercy wasn't overpowered and the myth that most Mercy players hid and rezzed was a nonproblem at best. I think the biggest reason she became a nuisance to some is because she could acquire her ult unreasonably fast for how powerful it was (and it was powerful to compensate for her kit.) It also doesn't help that the other healers have had their healing nerfed in one way or another, making Mercy's healing seem disproportionate in comparison (although I'd argue that a dedicated healer should do more healing).I just want the community to stop perpetuating the lie that Mercy has always been overpowered, viable, and a must pick. She was, at one point, for a very long time, considered underpowered and in dire need of a buff (or several)."

It'll take to long, and with the nature of OW being a reactive game; swapping is key. With roles being ambiguous, and dual nature (Dva is an offensive tank, Reinhardt is a defensive tank for instance) of several characters being a thing... heres a suggestion...HUBS. ADD SOCIAL HUBS. Every other Blizzard game has hubs; this is literally the only title that doesn't. So what this will do is allow players to find 6 stack groups easily without having to worry about insane queue times. So instead of hoping you dont get stacked with 5 dps mains (it happens), you can have a voluntary option to find a team that suits your needs instead of forcing you to be obligated to suffer through that.who this fixes - one tricks can find a team that supports them- teams arent forced to play with one tricks they dont feel are useful- teams arent forced to be put in roles they arent comfortable with (necessarily)All the while, keep the queue system the same, so if you just want to hop in, there it is. Minimal implementation coding, no game breaking mechanics changes, no queue changes, flex players get more options for teams, one tricks can find a team that works around their role, etc etc.  Theres literally zero downside to this that I can think of, open to critiques here."

Not everyone likes playing every tank, dps, healer, etc. So if someone were to play with a Healer selection but they only play mercy but mercy is taken what are they going to do if they don't know how to play any other healer, If defined as a role select system it could be that they don't have to ability to play any other role so their basically useless for their team if they cant convince the other player to trade.Also this would lead to longer queue times and worse team compositions, Because what happens when one of your players leave, Its either going to have to fill that role which means your not going to have a player for a longer time than usual or its going to give you a DPS to fill your healer role.Defining this role selection whatsoever could help a lot though, because your just calling it by a name with little meaning. It would either Enforce 2-2-2 or be more like a preferred role system where you could select a role you would like to play and possibly one that your okay with player, and maybe even one you definitely cannot play or will not play. There's also the issue still of how your going to match these players together because its either 2-2-2 for the preferred roles or player defined as to what else they would like on their team, With 2-2-2 it would most likely end up with longer queue times, Which would be pointless to add to ""Quick Play"" if your just going to increase Queue times. The best thing you could do for a system like this is go to a 3rd party website or something like that, that will help you join a team of players willing to fill those roles along with you then you can 6 stack matches with these roles, all done by the community.Other than that they don't intend to shift the meta, ideally it would be best for every hero to have a counter, to counter someone, and be equal to most other heroes, but at the current state of the game and basically every past state you shouldn't be trying to win alone, you should be communicating with your team and to out play the enemies and win, but this is all optional."

When asked about it, Blizzard states they won't do it because they don't want to force a meta. If you think about it though, Blizzard has been adjusting metas since Overwatch's release.For example, ask yourself these questions. Is it a coincidence that Ana, Lucio, D.Va, and Reignhart received nerfs during the triple tank era? Is it a coincidence that Zarya got her graviton buff during the dive meta? Is it a coincidence that Mercy got buffed when her play time was at all time low in high tiers?If you think reasonably, no. Blizzard intentionally impliments these changes to change metas and/or shift the balance of heroes. So the argument that ""we don't want to force a meta"" is completely hypocritical."

I'm not sure what you mean by "" CSGO Mechanics"" 4:3 streched isn't a ""CSGO Thing"" most games support these streched aspect ratios such as R6S. As to the implication that the streched aspect ratio makes it easier to hit targets I find that isn't really true it does enlargen everything horizontally, this however is only more visual as lowering your fov will also make the targets ""larger"". Also it's not a matter if how many people use 4:3 as I use this on a 16:9 Monitor ( I just prefer this streched aspect ratio ). Also the same principle in this change applies to 21:9 Monitors."
3803,https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760856614,4:3 Support / 4:3 Streched,NA,"Its not CSGO. CSGO mechanics dont work in overwatch, so stop applying CSGO mentality to games that arent CSGO. As such, the overwhelming majority of gamers are beyond 4:3 these days, its even difficult to find a monitor with that specific ratio. Not that I dont completely disagree with you; but there is obviously a reason they wont/dont do this.Here's some things to consider 1) aspect ratios will change, possibly giving you an unfair advantage2) stretched hit boxes might give you an unfair advantage3) FOV might be a hinderance, giving the other player an unfair advantage? 4) 4:3 is outdated my dude... no bones about this one. 5) how many people are using 4:3? Its probably the overwhelming minority that doesn't justify (any) time on this project."
3804,https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760856614,4:3 Support / 4:3 Streched,12/23/2017 1:40,"Why is there no 4:3 Resolution Support in Overwatch? Coming from CSGO I find it difficult to adjust ( As I normally play 1024 X 768 (streched) ). No, the answer is not 4:3 is an outdated aspect ratio. Even so, that doesn't mean it shouldn't be supported. I don't know about evryone else but I can only see benefits in adding support for 4:3 as well as 21:9. The only downside I can see is. Blizzard having to delegate some resources to this instead of new content. Even then, this should've been supported from the beginning. In conclusion, I think Blizzard needs to clarify wether this is an issue with the engine of Overwatch(idk I'm not a dev) or wether the support for these resolutions will come."

,,,,Omg. Ivan Vanko?
,,,,"And here I am, surprised that this is still a thing"
,,,,GOD I LOVE BEING AN OWL!
,,,,This HAS to be a reference. Two owl snipers? And I guess now we know exactly what is in Anas grenade. 
,,,,HOOT HOOOOOOT!!!
,,,,CAWWW/r/enlightenedbirdmen
,,,,im guessing you have nevermore and the green version?
,,,,"Just nevermore, don't like plague doctor. "
,,,,I'm so bummed I missed out on 80s Zarya :'(
,,,,I only managed to get cultist. 
,,,,I got Mei's zombie skin so there's that.
,,,,COMPLETELY AGREE. someone please make mercy a bird skin. Like a super cool pheniox please. 
,,,,"The only heroes right now with bird skins are Pharah, Reaper, Bastion (I literally consider Ganymedes existence sufficient), Widow, Rein (gryphon), Ana, and Zennyboi.Hanzo's wolf, Roadhog's pig, Sym's dragon, and hell even Lucio's frog skins will do in leu of. Every hero needs an animal themed skin. yesI'mafurrysueme"
,,,,Ex furry. Current bird enthusiast  (ex falconer) bird skins are my life. I fuckin love hanzos wolf skin. Mcree needs one.
,,,,You left the fandom? For real?Tell me your secret! These people are driving me mad with their drama! I miss college it's that bad some days.
,,,,I kinda just focued on other things. Cosplay got in the way. I still really want to make a fursuit because im passionate about creating things. But i dont interact with other furrys really.
,,,,"""OWL HEAD SNIPER, COMIN' THROUGH!!!!""throws bio grenade""OWL JARATE!"""
,,,,AHH ....PISS!
,,,,"Exactly my thought, I got the dragon skin in Halloween now I need the ice sombra skin to complete the set. HOOT HOOT skin needed too!!"
,,,,My EXACT thinking.  Also looking for that Kingdom Hearts Hanzo
,,,,I never stopped being a hog main.. and this skin like his last one is fucking S+
,,,,Really? Zenyatta and Zarya are my main squeezes as well. 
,,,,Teammates are just gonna shoot the puppies :’( 
,,,,"But, it shall never die!"
,,,,"Heroes never die, for a price!But puppies live forever for free!Wish game logic worked IRL. I miss my doggies."
,,,,"In quick play, Lucio Speed boosted me to get to Control point on Nepal. I quickly used the puppy emote and every stopped to appreciate itThen after like 5 seconds of going ""AWWWWW,"" Hanzo killed me with a scatter, then all hell broke loose.I'd like to believe Orisa took them all to save the puppy. Your protection is her primary concern... ( ;n;)"
,,,,"You know there should be a game mode that allows friendly fire (except in Ana’s case, she should still be able to sleep teammates) that way if any Hanzos (because it’s always a god damn Hanzo) pulls the same bullshit the Hanzo in your game pulled, then everyone should be able to shoot that mother fucker dead. "
,,,,Me
,,,,"Hold on.Ana gets a snow owl skin.Bastion gets a skin that turns Ganymede into a snow owl.Never in my wildest, edgiest theories could I have predicted this. Ana was Ganymede all along."
,,,,"I checked Ganymede in Arabic, and it is similiar to the word of ganimat, which means loot. Coincidence!? Certainly not messing up with translator on a language I have no idea about!"
,,,,Now we know what really happened to Hedwig.
,,,,I was hyped af for hanzos skin but somehow it seems off
,,,,It’s the beard
,,,,"And the body proportions. That jacket should be slimmer or something. And the pants already look they have a shitstain, then they hang low so it actually looks like he has a smelly load in em. Or a large ballsack lol"
,,,,Definitely body proportions. The waist is way too low. I'm fine with the beard.
,,,,i thought that was the main appeal of the skin
,,,,THE BEARD
,,,,Blizz keeps dropping the ball on Hanzo's skins
,,,,"The skin is still dope, but I prefer the dark green colors with the cool ear ring. "
,,,,Wait...is Orisa getting that puppy as an emote???? I need it!
,,,,"Haven’t logged in but apparently yes. Yes, we can get it as an emote.Unless someone has played a terrible, terrible joke on us."
,,,,The real question.. How did orisa not get a reindeer skin.. 
,,,,Because puppy is already too much awesomeness for 1 character for 1 event so they need to save reindeer for next year.
,,,,post launch characters besides Ana and Sombra getting stuffsweet summer child
,,,,Null sector OR14
,,,,You r reinhardt 
,,,,Not even a Genji skin where he throws snowflakes.
,,,,"Yeah, that leak was BS. It seemed like a low-effort epic and I believed it.I mean, I totally love every other skin we got this year, but that was rather sad."
,,,,"we should've known, because we never get epics."
,,,,"I miss 750 credits epic skins. Instead we get a bunch of legendaries that cost 3,000 each, and I can only afford one for every two events."
,,,,There was a leak with that? I just thought of it when I checked the hero gallery after the update went out. Guess that'd be a pretty easy epic to photoshop though.
,,,,"THAT ORISA EMOTE THO. Who cares about the legendary skins, Orisa having a puppy is all I care about."
,,,,That Sombra skin looks so cool!
,,,,"She looks soooo different, though. Even knowing who it is, I still barely recognize her!"
,,,,I wish they had made it epic and kept her hair though.
,,,,That'd require Blizzard still making epic skins
,,,,Yeah WTH most of the epics are great
,,,,They are putting out over 200 epic skins in January.
,,,,OWL?
,,,,Yeah
,,,,"Agreed, current hair doesn't seem to suit her."
,,,,Looks like another infamous female outlaw who is known for stealth from a blizzard gameVanessa Vancleef
,,,,"While true, Vanessa wasn’t exactly blue or covered in Ice"
,,,,Icy Vanessa is exactly what we need!But if they could I would love vancleef skins. I'd love vanessa sombra or widow and a mccree edwin
,,,,"Personally I love it since I didn't like Sombra's theme at all. That's the great thing about event skins, that even for those of us who don't like the basic design we can love redesigns. "
,,,,Same. This is the only Sombra skin I really like.
,,,,She's dressing up for the holidays!
,,,,But that hair style is kawaii af. 
,,,,"Fuck man, now i have to play overwatch again. It's a rule for me. I need to have every item for sombra"
,,,,"It should be great that she had na diferente ultimate voice line like ""Congelando las luces"""
,,,,I honestly don't like it. I don't like these fantasy-like skins for OW. I prefer the modern ones much more.
,,,,It also looks nothing like her. It doesn't keep a single aspect of her style.
,,,,You mean the style that has changed with every legendary? It's a theme that Sombra likes playing with her hair. 
,,,,She looks really ... Bayonetta in that screenshot
,,,,I finally understand why I love this screenshot so much
,,,,"I wish Tracer got a skin based on Bayonetta honestly, with (non functioning ofc) pistols on her heels and shit. "
,,,,How the fuck are we not talking about this Ana skin. Easily top 3 for me!
,,,,More like how are we not talking about Mei throwing down Junkrat's trap?
,,,,We already knew this from the winter land update video Jeff released last week. It’s only for the Yeti-Hunt game mode.
,,,,"Oh, I didn't see that video.  Understandable. "
,,,,Would be better with a visible face
,,,,I highly disagree. The Owl mask is amazing!
,,,,no
,,,,For me the mask is the best part maybe an option to unmask?
,,,,And here I thought with 7k currency grinded I had enough for my favorites.. RIP my free time.Ameizing
,,,,here it is on youtube https://youtu.be/IyzMyugk8xM
,,,,Heh...Winter Soldier.
,,,,"Oh look, fuck all for Pharah once again."
,,,,"Cross your fingers for a lunar new year, chinese dragon themed pharah skin that ults fireworks, my dude"
,,,,Year of the Dog is next though...
,,,,"Oooh yeah, I forgot about all the bird costume skins everyone got because it was year of the rooster.Oh wait I didnt forget, none of them got any."
,,,,"The closest we got was Bastion's skin, which turned Ganymede into a rooster."
,,,,"Pharah has Anubis skins, so a Dog-themed skin for Chinese New Year that ults fireworks would be good."
,,,,ice queen pharah already exists and is fucking awesome tho 
,,,,And Doomfist. He's been around for 3 events now has gotten nothing. Not even a new emote. 
,,,,She deserves nothing.
,,,,so many cool skins - I love how Junkrat is such a joke lol
,,,,"Nah, December is summer in Australia. It's actually geographically correct, LOL."
,,,,"Would be nice if this became a running gag for Winter Wonderland, every character that lives in the south hemisphere actually wearing summer clothes for christmas. In Brazil is so hot on december that we have many songs about how Santa has to change clothes to come here and instead of warm milk would be better to let the ar condicion/ electric fan on. Or christmas is usually at the beach, or people spend at home and the go to beach's for the new year's eve. "
,,,,"...OMG now I have a mighty need for summer Christmas Lucio. :o I have no idea what that would entail, but that sounds fantastic."
,,,,"Something like surfer wear, but his trunks are Christmas-themed and his necklace is Christmas lights?"
,,,,It's almost a shame he's not Hawaiian.  Luau Santa could work with him.
,,,,Except that his buddy roadhog gets consistently wintery and festive skins. Geographically correct but thematically inconsistent...literally unplayable
,,,,And still no mittens for junk. FeelsColdMan :(
,,,,hashtagMITTENSFORJUNKRAT !!!
,,,,It's a real shame for anyone who mains junkrat...the joke wears off after .01 seconds and all we are left with is a trash skin that costs 3000 gold
,,,,"Maybe Roadie just really likes snow, IDK."
,,,,He just decided to go even further south and visit antartica for a while...
,,,,Doesn't that mean that Lucio should have a summer skin as well? I thought Brazil was in the southern hemisphere.
,,,,Secret Canadian.
,,,,"That hanzo skin would be awesome if it wasn't for the disconnected grey beard, ruins the whole skin"
,,,,"Can we get a recolor for Hanzo? Not digging the grey beard/black hair look especially with it disconnected all the way through (i can look pass that though), but yeah just all grey or black hair Hanzo, would buy loot boxes for that. Love the Ana/Sombra skin tho!"
,,,,Witcher Hanzo skin!!!
,,,,"""Genji, Genji, what a prick."""
,,,,"Beat me to it, fucking amazing skins man. "
,,,,Junkrat looks like Casey Neistat
,,,,i'm waiting for comments like this.
,,,,OHMIGODBASTIONSSKINISADORABLEAHHHHHH
,,,,The maps look amazing with the winter makeover.  That Ana skin and Orisa emote are at the top of my wish list. 
,,,,Mei and Winston were pretty friendly considering that he was about to murder her if it wasn't for the bear trap she had with her.
,,,,What was that junk rat thing at the end?
,,,,It’s summer in Australia so it was showing how Junkrat is spending his Christmas vacation!
,,,,Oh I got it. Thanks
,,,,"Thankfully, I'm not really feeling any of the skins this event. I can get my Orisa puppy and keep my money!"
,,,,"Orisa featured in the video but no new skin, why Blizzard? "
,,,,New Emote!
,,,,"Man, feels bad when your first arcade lootbox has a legendary, but it's a non-event legendary. An ugly one at that (IMO)."
,,,,I promised not to spend any more money on lootboxes after dropping about $300 Aud since release. Now I must break that promise.Sombra skin and lil puppy come at me. 
,,,,"I just have one question, does Mercy get some Christmas love?"
,,,,"She do not, my dude."
,,,,She gets a very cute new victory pose!
,,,,She gets a new emote I think
,,,,Mercy got enought love for a lifetime
,,,,"Every event, I usually see what I get out of boxes and then wait to buy what I want at the very end... But hoo boy I'm smashing that unlock button for the Roadhog skin as soon as I log in"
,,,,Any tips for Meis snowball gametype? Im diamond but havent gotten a kill in the 2 games i played of it.  The Yeti one seems just weird to me as well. I dont understand what im doing with her Ult in either gametype.
,,,,"im not too good with the snowball one but the yeti one is pretty easy. All you really have to do is bunch of with your mei pals, ice wall the yeti in some corridor and have cycle freezing/ icicle shooting. "
,,,,"Ult in snowball fight lets you shoot snowballs without having to pick up snow, temporarily of course. It takes a bit of getting used to how the snowballs fire, but body shots are key because its a 1hko anyways."
,,,,The ult is a bear trap. Put it on the meat.
,,,,Confirmation that traps are gay.
,,,,I thought it was funny
,,,,Sigh... my computer just broke. Dont know how long it will take to fix it. :(
,,,,"The skins are amazing, they are so far the best ones. That Sombra skin is amazing! Better than last years at lease!"
,,,,i like the direction in the video and how it flows
,,,,"Takeaways:-Mei's new event looks pretty interesting. I'll have to see how it plays in game. The trap appears to just be Junkrat's trap, but it'll be interesting to see how people use this in terms of her strategy for this mode and how this could potentially effect her kit in the future.-A lot of the skins look pretty cool. I'm a fan of Bastion, Hanzo, and Sombra's new skins. Roadhog and Ana also look pretty cool, but honestly, that's about it for me. I still have some other skins I missed out on from last year (such as Santa Torb), so I'll probably only get one of the above. But honestly, I'm fine with whatever.-No matter what happens I will get that puppy emote and protect that dog with my life and beyond."
,,,,RIP this even't because of my defect PC :(
,,,,Wishing you a better one for Christmas :)
,,,,Does it bother anyone that the dog disappears if Orisa gets killed? Summon a puppy on a payload...should I stop it?
,,,,"Blizzard, why didn’t I get any gifts? :-( my main menu is the elf costume scene from last year."
,,,,The Hanzo skin would've been good if he didn't have grey hair :( Idk it just bothers me because he's only 38 and it's too much grey hair. 
,,,,Most wonderful if you dont live somewhere it snows 4-5 months a year!
,,,,I G G Y !
,,,,fix hanzo's skin plz
,,,,"I don’t play hanzo, but I was so hyped about this skin. I was going to have it as my main skin and use the hell out of it. But it looks damn terrible. I’m not going to get it unless they patch this. I can’t decide what is worse, The white cotton balls glued to the side of his head, the weird bald strip, the saggy pants, or the out of place piercings.One user fixed these problems. So for the love of overwatch please fix this."
,,,,New Hanzo Skin”Casual”FILTY CASUALS REEEEE
,,,,"Sombra should have a diferente ultimate voice line in her new skin,one example:""Congelando las luces"".Can you do this,please,I'd appreciate a lot"

,,,,"I never said they weren't top notch. I simply said I was disappointed with the offering this season. None of these skins are really of interest to me, and none are for heroes I play. Also, the game modes are pretty meh, in my opinion.Maybe I'm wrong, and everyone will be singing it's praises until the new year event, but it disappointed me. "
,,,,NA
,,,,NA
,,,,"Wait, cryo-freeze is supposed to clear the grenade debuff? I always thought that was intentional."
,,,,"Yeah, that seems like a big change. A good Ana getting that grenade on a Mei before she freezes was huge."
,,,,Seems like a Mei buff disguised as a bug fix
,,,,Was listed as a bug over a year ago. They just finally got around to it. But definitely a nice buff for Mei
,,,,"Yeah, if anybody ever played Ana."
,,,,"Which they shouldn't because most people are terrible as Ana.  Not to say that she shouldn't get play but.... you're not that good at aiming, most of you. Edit: I guess I should clarify more...  A lot of people pick Ana because she was one of the main Meta healers and they think that she's going to be a big advantage if they just pick her without really being good at being a sniper.  Yea you can practice with her and that helps but don't just think you have a leg up just because you're playing as her.  And also pay attention to who is on your team because team comp REALLY matters for Ana. "
,,,,Can't get better if you don't practice my dude.
,,,,Thank you!
,,,,"While shes zoomed ally hitboxs are massively increased.  It doesn't remove the ability to ""aim"" from the equation it just helps hitting that ally Genji jumping around. If a team plays around an Ana (not running behind walls and barriers) she can output a ton of healing."
,,,,"It's not that people don't have the skill to play ana, it's that mercy is an all around better hero. If your gold or lower I might agree with that statement, but I don't think Ana's shots are that hard to hit. Valk &gt; nano also it's basically an easy team fight win when used correctly. Nano is much easier to counter."
,,,,"Thats one of the biggest problems with the support classes. You have the offence/backup healers, and the main ones. The main ones being mercy and ana. Ana has her grenade... And thats it. Nano boost is no longer good, unless you and a genji god like me justkiddingimtrash are the only ones left and you both have your ults up and melt the enemy team. With mercy, on the other hand, you have:Very high, easy to hit and target healing beamsDamage boosts, available at any time.very high mobilitycan fucking flyzen/supercharge ult at once and can also fucking fly gooder during her easy to obtain ult."
,,,,"It makes sense, it is an invul ability like wraith form and that one clears the debuff as well. Just strange that it took so long to fix. "
,,,,Yeah but the whole point of the nade is to prevent healing. Seems like it should remove the debuff but also still prevent mei from getting health from her ice

,,,,A quick suggestion to blizzard.Separate the non game play bugs from the game play bugs.Maria’s eyelashes and Doomfist punches have 2 totally different impacts
,,,,Upvoting for the “Maria”
,,,,"Maria, Maria, she reminds me of a west side story"
,,,,Nerf Maria's eyelashes ffs
,,,,I've run into a few people mispronoumcing her name as Maria. Unless they meant to like ganja/Genji.

,,,,Can Moira damage Torbjorn's turret now?
,,,,This and will her damage biotic orb now target Symmetra turrets and Torborn Turrets. Read it should.
,,,,So throwing a biotic orb destroys any Symmetra turrets immediately? I thought that  was intentional since it seems too easy unlike destroying a torb turret
,,,,How about Zarya's bubble ? Why it won't release any damage to bubbled enemy ?
,,,,Shhh... Let's keep that on the DL pls
,,,,"Barriers block the orbs ""lock on"". If it blocks the lock on, no damage is given out as it ""CANT"" initiate."
,,,,"Absolutely not ! barrier won't block lock on as symmetra, winston, and turrets still able to do damage to it. don't spread misinformation here."
,,,,But Sombra can't hack through Zaryas barrier. So some lock on effects are cancelled.
,,,,"Indeed, but all barriers block the orb doing damage via it's lock on, that is fact. Just as Reindhart blocks Sombra hack."
,,,,The new Orisa emote is freaking adorable.
,,,,"""Fixed a bug that caused Moira’s eyelashes to detach from her face during her Heroic highlight intro""HAHAHA WHAT"

,,,,Torb's scrap meter is back to orange too now
,,,,Really?? That's good to hear!
,,,,"Players who report someone for poor behavior, resulting in a disciplinary action, will now be notified with an in-game message when the issue has been resolved. About time. Ranked competitive has been a toxic mess since season 1. Hope this change will be for the better."
,,,,I'm almost more excited that the players who are getting reported will be notified of each report (if I read that right).
,,,,You get a warning when you're close to being banned 
,,,,"Launched the game a received the notification about my report being effective right away. Dunno if it's a placebo, but it felt really good knowing that Hanzo cunt (he was level 900, had 5 minutes on Hanzo among ALL game modes, he played Symmetra at start of the round and when Tracer destroyed his TP right away, he switched and proceded to suicide by feeding enemy team) I've reported today got at least a notification about his behavior. "
,,,,"Yea, I haven’t played comp since season 1 primarily due to trolling and other toxic player interactions.

,,,,"I hope though that they don’t receive a message immediately after each report. Like if someone being toxic I game receives a notification in game that someone reported them, are they likely to be worse? Do they start a witch hunt for the person in their game that reported them?

,,,,"The accuracy stat has been changed as well, it no longer gives you more accuracy % when you shoot on shields (at least at Reinhardt's shield as McCree)"
,,,,Hopefully it doesn't lower accuracy percentage. Don't want to discourage people from breaking shields.

,,,,This feels like such a mistake. Hope they change it. 
,,,,"SR losses because of 'personal performance/ accuracy"" incoming. "
,,,,This is listed as a bug on the forums https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760285893
,,,,"Still no fix for Moira orbs disappearing when they hit Mei walls, GG"
,,,,I'm pretty sure orbs go through walls. I've shot damage orbs at walls and subsequently heard them doing damage on the other side.
,,,,I think people discussed it on here before and reasoned that it was intentional
,,,,It seems odd. Mei walls count as climbable walls for Hanzo/Genji so why would they be treated as anything but a wall for everything else?  
,,,,"Not really. Mei's wall records block damage, and its solid. It should be able to take an Orb.  Right now the only other orb counter is Dva matrix so this is fair "
,,,,Except Moira’s ball isn’t like Symmetras. It’s an entity that bounces off terrain. 
,,,,It's also weird that it won't release any damage to Zarya's bubble.
,,,,That’s fair but it shouldn’t happen with FRIENDLY Mei walls.
,,,,And Genji reflect. And walking in the opposite direction the slow ball is moving.
,,,,I was more excited about these than the event to be honest lol. Doomfist main btw
,,,,Where's the bot that does these?
,,,,"Player Warning UpdatesSeveral changes have been made to the player report system.Players being reported will receive an in-game message letting them know that they have been reported, along with a warning concerning continued negative behavior.

We take every report seriously, along with your feedback. Thank you for your patience as we continue to fine tune these systems.We needed some changes in the report system, but this one will be a tough pill to swallow. Lots of people throwing after seeing the message. Not to say anything about the instantaneous satisfaction for those reporting people who are streaming and being able to see in real time the effects of their actions. It would be nice to have some punishment for those who are reporting as a sport."
,,,,Would be great if the notification came after a game. Like how the deranking message does.
,,,,"I wouldn’t want them to be notified immediately, though, because they could look for and harass the people in the game who may have reported them. I hope they get notified either after receiving a number of reports or sometime later and not right after a game. "
,,,,Exactly. This will lead to (even more) people throwing games or tilting the rest of the team.
,,,,"That would be better, yes. We'll just have to wait for people to start sharing their impending punishments before we know how the system is implemented."

,,,,"Huzzah, thank you for posting these!"
,,,,Hey! Not all the fixes in but it's getting there! /u/kid-karma
,,,,Ever since they said Moira's fade collisions were a bug i just had to stop playing for a bit. I loved playing her but knowing that i just couldn't really enjoy the game anymore until they went live with it. Good time to take a break though. Now with Moira and Doomfist fixes it's time to head straight into FFADM.
,,,,that tiny bug ruined the game for you? What? 
,,,,It sounds like when Doomfist was in the PTR and there was a bug that players got used to and were making it their DF strategy - ultimately got taken away and players were complaining about not knowing how to play DF now....Only..the opposite situation?
,,,,what again? 
,,,,"I was getting a little burnt out at the time but yeah. Once i knew she was not supposed to have the collision with fade it became increasingly annoying. I didn't want to waste my time playing her like that and adapt to it only for it to be fixed a few weeks later, and i really only wanted to play moira at the time. The game was not ruined for me or anything but it certainly was what the lead to me not playing for a couple weeks. When something is improved of fixed in the ptr it can sometimes make playing the live build feel obsolete."
,,,,"Fixed a bug that prevented Widowmaker’s Grappling hook from pulling players to moveable objects, even when they were stationary (e.g. the window on the Eichenwalde Castle doorsPraise Jeff"
,,,,The real hero of the patch notes: “-Players can now clear new item notifications with the “Mark All as Seen” button in the Hero Gallery.”

,,,,"Fixed an issue that prevented highlights captured by Zenyatta players from recording correctly when the Cultist skin was equipped""Experience... Madness..."" had been nerfed. "
,,,,What about the bug that allows Moira to heal through shields?
,,,,"Wait, does Moira still can not shoot Torb's turret????!!!"
,,,,And over a year and a half later and they still haven't fixed the Symmetra bugs. Pathetic.
,,,,And those bugs would be...?
,,,,"The several bugs associated with Mei's ice wall. Mainly having ones weapon lock onto friendly Mei ice walls, and not getting primary charge on enemy Mei ice walls. They've already directly addressed this as ""unintended"" but have yet to actually fix it, in fact they made it worse twice. Let that sink in.The lack of turrets staying deployed when you die right after placing them. Then a more recent bug that's only been around a year is Roadhog hooks going through her photon barrier and hooking her which is fine because of latency but then after the hook and before the pull in not getting canceled because it went through the barrier."
,,,,"The lack of turrets staying deployed when you die right after placing them.Not a bug. Happens with Torb too, buildings die while in the process of being built if the builder dies.Then a more recent bug that's only been around a year is Roadhog hooks going through her photon barrier and hooking her which is fine because of latency but then after the hook and before the pull in not getting canceled because it went through the barrier.I'm not exactly sure what you are saying here, but it sounds like you are saying the hook hits Symmetra, she puts up the shield, and then is pulled in? If this is what you are saying, I'm pretty sure this happens with all shields if they come up after the hook makes contact."
,,,,I think every things including projectile will immediately disappear while you are dying. Like many ults (e.g. Mei's ult) that were mentioned before.
,,,,"The buildings are consistent, while the projectiles seem to be inconsistent. The only projectile disappearance I've had was Mei's ult a while back. I haven't played Mei anytime recently, but on other characters (Tracer, McCree, Moira, etc) my projectiles continue after death. I have seen the posts on this subreddit of the projectiles disappearing, so I won't dispute that it happens, but I don't think it happens all the time for some reason."
,,,,"Yes it's a bug, if it's been placed and activates cooldown then it should stay placed. The subsequent animation should logically be independent of the symmetra.Correct the shield should break the hook as it blocks it in the first place, and logically symmetra shouldn't have been hooked in the first place since her barrier was deployed but the hook glitched through it, probably due to latency with the game. So the hook actually should be altogether canceled in the first place far less also canceled by the fact the barrier should cut the chain."
,,,,"Concerning Reins charge to escape Grav, shouldn’t Reaper not be able to escape either? Seeing the buff that Zarya got that disabled all movement. I’m aware Reaper can use wraith to get out. However, does that sort of not defeat the purpose for the buff to begin with?Thinking out loud here and somewhat confused. "
,,,,"The difference is Reaper's Wraith makes him unable to be targetted. The only other abilities that can escape Graviton are Moira's Fade (for the same reason), Orisa's Fortify (can't be movement impaired), and people invincible from Mercy's Res. Before, all Graviton did was stop general movement, so a lot of movement related abilities could escape."
,,,,"Grav disables movement abilities, not invulnerability abilities."
,,,,Moira can escape it as well.
,,,,"No it is intended, same as Moira's fade. Since they are fundamentally the same ability, it makes sense both can. They seem to lose all mass. In doing so, gravity has no effect on them."
,,,,lol you are going to submit this and then remove posts for similar content.
,,,,still no genji nerf
,,,,Why would you nerf Genji? He's pretty well balanced. 
,,,,"Lol, Mei buffed, Moira Buffed and Genji loses his ultimate if killed in his animation. As a Moira main I have slain thousands of Genjis. He is currently struggling as a good pick.He is weak now.  What is your issue with Genji?"
,,,,"Sadly, the main problem for me is that they didn't deal with Valkyrie, as a Tracer main it's so infuriating how for 20 seconds, they let her be invincible to me. That high up in the air, dmg fall off and two resses feels way to much. Deal with it Blizzard, please!"
,,,,NA
,,,,NA
,,,,What does it mean when you use your ult and the icon is red in the kill feed?
,,,,"Generally, if any icon in the killfeed is red, that means that the final blow was a headshot. For ults, it's no different."
,,,,Why is quick play matching me with 5 other players &gt;level 30 but the other team almost always has 3 players &gt;level 50 with the other 3 being whatever level.I want to just play some random games but we keep getting steamrolled with the newer players 
,,,,"I remember Jeff mentioning quite a while back, maybe at the beginning of the year, that they were going to try to enable changing skins on the fly in hero select.

,,,,"So, with a winrate that low, it might be partially your fault. Statistically, your winrate should be close to 50%. The more games you play, the closer it should be to that number. The only variable that all of those games share is yourself. While it's possible for a coinflip to come up tails every single time, it is very, very unlikely. It's possible to play well on a hero but not contribute to a win. For example, I played with a Genji once that would constantly get doubles and triples with dragonblade, but he would often do it when almost everyone else on our team was dead. He'd inevitably lose the 1v3 once his ult was over, and they'd cap the point. He got lots of eliminations, but he effectively wasted his ult each time. "

,,,,"So I know everyone complained about tracer getting too many event skins, but at this point she hasn't had a skin since th e anniversary event about 6 months ago.  At what point do you guys think it's fair she's open to getting more skins?"

Orisa needs love!"
,,,,I got my friends into playing overwatch and recently they've coasted off into other games. How can I get them interested again in the game?

,,,,"No friendly ability will actually pull Sombra out of invisibility. But Zarya bubbles, Mercy's beam, and Moira orbs could alert the enemy team to their location. An empty Zarya bubble running around is pretty suspicious..."
,,,,"Nothing friendly will make her visible. Only taking or dealing damage and getting too close to an enemy (that will make her briefly visible).Mercy's beam disappears into nothing at around 1/3 of the distance between Mercy and an invisible Sombra, Zarya's bubble will show empty, Zen's orb is invisible too, Moira's Orb will latch onto an invisible Sombra but enemies will see it latch onto nothing."
,,,,Zarya bubble will 
,,,,"Will the game let me know if the person I reported got punished? Also, if I don't hear anything does that mean they didn't get punished?"

,,,,"I've had this question for months now. I'm a silver pharah main, and I recently got very good at her, and I'm pretty sure it is because of my direct hits.

Is there a place and time to do either? Please help."
,,,,"I would always click, unless you're specifically in a situation where it's impossible to miss, like into a graviton."
,,,,"That's how I've been thinking, but what about if I'm behind an orisa sheild pocket where there's 3 people in splash range and it's pretty hard to miss, should I just hold down for max fire rate until they scatter? PS. Do u play pharah?"
,,,,"Plat Pharah main here...I find it better to be consistent regardless of situation, so I always click for each individual rocket.Fun tip: when you're about to ult on a nice cluster (like a group trapped in Graviton Surge), fire a single regular rocket just before you hit Q, it's basically a free extra bit of burst damage :)"
,,,,"I haven't played much Pharah recently, but I used to. ~60 hours playtime I think.I would always still tab. An extra splitsecond between shots is worth securing a direct hit for. Securing more single-target is worth slightly forgoing the AoE damage IMO."

,,,,There are lots of mercy one tricksso if u get another mercy playerur fucked
,,,,"Probably because unless you're very good (which obviously you are to be in Master rank), maining support can be very unrewarding since you rely entirely on your team to keep you protected and to capitalize on opportunities you provide. Most support mains I know are much more comfortable queueing with a DPS or tank main that they know and trust. It's part of why Pharmercy is such a popular combination."
,,,,65% winrate. It can't be that bad... 
,,,,"Well good for you guys! I used to main Mercy, Lucio and Ana and I never got more than a few SR into Silver because I could just never do anything impactful. Switched to Pharah main in later seasons and hit Platinum this week."
,,,,"I had a similar experience. I mained support essentially from season 1-6 and never really passed 2800. Season 7 I decided to main dva as often as I could, and climbed to around 3100. Sometimes maining support can be very challenging. The supports that are in the top ranks are very exceptional. Sometimes it feels like you're doing very well as support, but in reality you might be average or less."
,,,,Congrats!
,,,,"The big glaring problem I see: by duoing as support mains, this basically means you will be in conflict if you ever get a team with even one rando support main. And there are a lot of rando support mains.When grouping for comp, it is best to either group with versatile players, or group with varying roles, to maximize the likelihood there won't be role-conflicts within your team.Can either of you effectively fill other roles besides support? What do you do if you team with a rando support onetrick?"
,,,,"Same reason people get pissed if a duo instalock dps. It's cool if you can flex and are willing to, but just means one entire role has been taken from the rest of your team. "

I applied the lowest settings to windows settings, the graphics settings, the game's settings, and i prioritized the game to real time to get at least 30 fps. Before i downloaded overwatch I also factory reset my computer.My question is why do i get better fps when i used windowed settings and not full screen"
,,,,"Running at the same resolution should perform better in full screen.  e.g. a 1920x1080 window should perform worse than running full screen at 1920x1080.  A 1280x720 (or whatever) window will obviously be a lot less work for your (incredibly shitty integrated) GPU to render.But you don’t have to run full screen at your laptop/monitor’s native resolution.  You can either pick a lower one, or (usually preferably) turn down the “render scale” option so it draws the UI sharp but renders the 3D world at a lower resolution internally."
,,,,"Typically, people talking about performance of windowed versus full screen are doing so under the assumption that ""windowed""is shorthand for ""borderless window filling the full screen"".Full screen takes advantage of some OS optimizations for applications in this mode, but earlier implementations of these optimizations would often lead to games crashing or behaving poorly when switching between programs (alt-tabbing to check a guide while the game is still running, for example).  These problems have largely been solved in modern games and operating systems, so there is generally very little reason to opt for borderless windowed anymore if you're playing on the whole size of your monitor.With that background out of the way, we can move on to your question.  Yes, you are losing those full screen optimizations running in windowed mode, but this is vastly overshadowed by the fact that your graphics processor needs to render fewer pixels due to the lowered effective screen resolution your game is playing at.  This makes a huge difference.  If every frame is that much smaller (in resolution) it's much easier for a system under strain to make more of them, faster.  Same reason why someone might get a giant new monitor without upgrading their graphics card, only to be frustrated by a large performance drop when they start using it to play games.I'm glad you were able to find settings that work for you!  Enjoy the game!"

Weirdly enough the cursor appears on the screen, the only way I was able to fix it was through a reset, which cost me 50 SR and a suspension :/Is this a known bug or should I report it on the forums?

I try to stay away, fly to other people, I could counter him myself if I switched but that wouldn't help if I'm the only healer.

,,,,"If I am getting damaged boosted, do I get my ult faster?"
,,,,Any boost to damage increases the amount of ult charge you get from dealing damage to heroes. Nanoboost also increases damage enough to substantially boost ult charge.

,,,,"Only if you damage heroes, not barriers or turrets."

Also if you've used cryo and Winston knows it, you're toast if he can jump over your wall (and jump has much better uptime than wall) and you don't have friends to freeze/extra wall him to give you an escape.In fact keep your distance as much as possible; you don't want to be in Tesla range (which is only 2m shorter than your beam) if you can help it. Pop the dang bubble! Within 25m, it takes eight icicles to pop the bubble; with five hunters, that takes only a little over a second. Trying to walk through the bubble just gets you unnecessarily zapped, which puts you closer to being vulnerable because you had to use cryo."

,,,,How is decay calculated 
,,,,"I take ""decay"" here as ""SR and rank decay""Only applied to Diamond, Master, and Grandmaster. Every match you play add 36 hours into a timer, and the timer can be added upto 7 days (168 hours) at max.After the timer runs out of time, your SR will be decreased by 25. And each 24 hours after that, your SR is further decreased by 25 until you play again, and add more time the timer.Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Diamond will now be moved into lower skill tiers if they cannot maintain the minimum skill rating for that tier over five games. For example if your rank is Gold and SR drop lower than 2000 and after 5 games you cannot climb back to an SR greater or equal to 2000, your rank will be dropped to Silver."
,,,,Thank you 
,,,,Would it be OP if Reinhardt could 1-shot with Earthshatter assuming he lands the hammer directly on the target?
,,,,prob. yes because you could for example onehit everyone in a zarya grav
,,,,"Probably not. Anything that gets knocked down is as good as dead anyway for practical team fight purposes.Still, it would give him potential for two instant kills that don't require aim (after charge) which seems wrong on a main tank."
,,,,"Anything that gets knocked down is as good as dead anyway for practical team fight purposes.That's not very true, and even if it is, it still takes times to kill those enemies. Time spent being shot at and not killing the rest of the enemy team. If you could shatter and immediately turn a 6v6 into a 4v6, that would be absolutely crazy broken"
,,,,Yes.
,,,,"Whenever I get a windows popup notification it pulls me out of the game. Overwatch is the ONLY game where it'll pull me to the desktop, how do I stop that shit?"

,,,,What’s considered poor vs. average vs. good weapon accuracy for each of the heroes?
,,,,"Accuracy is one of those stats that can be misleading.  Higher isn’t always better if it means you’re playing too cautiously and not dealing as much damage overall.  It’s more important to hit the shots that count (finishing a fleeing enemy, shutting down an ult, landing a Widow headshot against their Mercy, etc.)Stat sites like Overbuff, Overwolf, etc. can give stat ranges for each hero in each competitive tier if you want to compare yourself to other players.  But raw stats are only part of the story."
,,,,It's hard to say man . Some heroes require you to be constantly spamming to  build your ult faster so your overall accuracy will be lower even though you 're playing appropriately. 
,,,,"You'd have more success asking about the specific heroes you're interested in, it's different for every hero and no one knows the whole list. And it's also different based on your play style. An aggressive Widow who always uses her machine gun a lot is going to have a different accuracy to one who's very careful with her shots, but they may be just as 'skilled' as each other. Etc etc."
,,,,"I think good aim require you have an accuracy of 50% and above? But it is subjective to each hero, and I am unable to list them all. Maybe bring this question to /r/OverwatchUniversity."
,,,,What should I do to improve my aim? It's pretty hard to improve your aim for a game with varied hitboxes on Xbox.
,,,,Try lowering your sensitivity. Helps me on certain dps heroes.
,,,,Practice will always be the best answer to this question. I would recommend tinkering with the different cross-hairs to see which are the best for you =] The best way I worked on accuracy was forcing myself to use the dot cross-hair which is now my favorite one but each person has different preferences. 
,,,,"If genii deflects a Moira orb, does the time it exists remain unaffected or does the orbs lifespan restart?"

,,,,Would anyone happen to know how to make Widowmaker’s normal crosshair different from her scoped crosshair?

,,,,"So, what are some tips you guys have for someone fairly new to the game (I bought it about a month ago, even playing non-stop but I'm still terrible at it.), that's stuck in bronze and can't get out to save her life. "
,,,,"That's just natural :P We all start somewhere so don't stress about it too much. Try out all the different heroes so you at least get a feel for what their kits do. After that, see which ones you like and focus on them. Most of the skills you need for overwatch will just naturally come with time and experience. Try to hone your general awareness, whether that be listening to what's going on around you, what threats are present, looking at the kill feed to see how your team is faring, what ults your team has up, what ults the enemy team might have up, etc. Having good awareness will lead to having good game sense.Always try to play the objective, the objective is the number one priority and it is also what many newer players neglect. Learn how to analyse the objective timer as it can be confusing to understand for beginners. For example, overtime will start to tick if you guys are on 99% and the other team is on 0 but still contesting. Whilst your gut reaction may be to panic and try to touch point - that is often the wrong decision. Instead, realise that your team only needs 1% more and it is ok to let the enemy cap the point in order to regroup as a team and push together. On the flip side, recognise which overtimes mean TOUCH the point and STAY on the point using whatever means possible. It is all too common to pull a c9 - meaning that a team has the opportunity to contest the point but don't do so and lose the game. If you notice that your team is pushed all the way up but the point hasn't been capped, sit on the point and cap it yourself. If you notice there is nobody on payload, let your team know or sit on it yourself. Trickling is BAD. Don't trickle, don't let your team trickle, spam that group up button when you notice people are just going onto the point one by one and dying. Sorry about the long ass essay, I'm on a flight atm so I have a lot of time. These are just some general things to look out for but if you have hero specific questions, I can try to answer those as well. "
,,,,"I hear that playing the ""main"" heroes - mercy, reinhardt, and S76 - will force you to learn many game fundamentals for your place in the team fight. Try not to be a one-trick, but do spend a little dedicated time learning to contribute with each hero - you may be surprised with who comes more easily and more enjoyable to you (for me, it was Ana)."
,,,,"i find myself having a shit time playing 76, mostly cuz to me he’s just too easy. same with rein. so ive been trying to branch out and play Ana and genji because theyre a bit more difficult "
,,,,"I'd caution against overlooking the ""easy"" heroes when you're starting out, especially if your goal is to improve.  A simple kit frees up brainpower to focus on fundamentals like positioning, awareness, target prioritization, ult tracking, and the like.  If you're in bronze, I can guarantee that you need to work on these things (heck, we all do), and the depth in these simple kits may surprise you.  Soldier 76 has many animation cancel abilities and advanced movement, for example, as does Reinhardt.Of course, if mechanical complexity is fundamental to you having fun, by all means play what brings you joy.  Ana and Genji are both excellent choices in that regard.  Either way, welcome!  I hope you enjoy the game! "
,,,,"Tried the off-tanks yet? Zarya, Winston, D.va, Mei. They all have quite a lot of potential for rewarding careful application of their abilities and can menace in a fight."
,,,,"Just my personal experienceI'd say start out with less mechanically difficult characters (like mercy or junkrat) to help learn the basics of the game.Watch professionals play. watching anything like Overwatch League or the Overwatch Worldcup will have sportscasters so they will give you even more info.Browse for some custom games to help with aim. Playing ""Bad Widow's Only"" custom games helped my aim quite a bit. Play Mystery Heroes to get a better idea of how every single character plays."
,,,,"Two tips!1) Be mindful. People make a lot of mistakes in all tiers of this game.  Watch for them and try to punish them. Try not to make the same mistake twice yourself. If you aren't sure yet what is a mistake, just ask yourself the following: Am I really far from my team? Is that enemy alone? Is that enemy not looking at you? Capitalize on these things.2) Group up. There's safety in numbers. If people keep going in by themselves, pick someone (like a tank) to go with, this is now your buddy and you want to keep them alive. Protect them, try to help them make a play.And always have fun! Skill in anything is a learned trait, you will get there."
,,,,thanks :) 
,,,,Do Hanzo's arrows come back down?
,,,,"If shot nearly straight up?Yes, but there is a height limit and any projectiles that go above it go “poof”.  Before they added that there were a bunch of maps where you could stand at/near your spawn and hit people almost anywhere on the map if you aimed right.  Or aim straight up and have deadly arrows fall back down out of nowhere ~5s later."
,,,,Hanzo trick shot
,,,,If he shoots them straight up in the air? Yes.
,,,,Does Reaper heal himself as he shoots D. Va's mech?
,,,,He heals any time he does damage with his primary fire.
,,,,Even into buildings? (Torb turret for example)
,,,,"No, just into heroes, not built objects."

,,,,"I just started playing the other day (level 16). What's considered ""good"" during quickplays? Like, how many gold/silver/bronze medals should I be getting?"
,,,,"Medals don't matter, the only thing that matters is winning the game. Getting 5 golds is irrelevant if you lose. Good in Quick Play is surviving with your team, killing enemies, and standing on the objective."
,,,,So even if you're the best player on the team but your team (aren't teams random?) still loses in competitive you lose rank? That's the most ridiculous thing. 
,,,,"It currently takes your performance into account, more than just medals. This is changing however for diamond and above to be purely based on W/L. Medals are not very useful, you can get gold medals and still be the worst player on the team if you are staggering, out of position, not enabling your team etc. The only goal is to win by any means.It's not ridiculous though, it's the best way to rank a person over enough games. Your team has 5 random people the enemy team has 6, you are the only constant and over time your skill will depict your SR by winning more than you lose. "

,,,,"So is football, but if you put Tom Brady on the Browns they would still have a losing season but Brady would still be performing reasonably well. "
,,,,Anything above half on average :)Mercy is the only character I have a hard time getting more than 2 medals on.
,,,,As in three gold medals or three medals period? 
,,,,"if you have any medal you're in the top 3-4 of that category on your team so you're doing pretty good. Silver means you're better than avg and gold is obviously the best on the team. If you end a match with 3-4 gold medals you've done a really good job compared to everyone else. Keep in mind you can pretty easily tie for things like elims.This is relative however, if you get blown out by the other team and you have gold elims with 3, don't get a big ego... it's amazing how many people like to brag about having gold elims in a loss."
,,,,"Gold healing for support (except symmetra), gold eliminations for offense and damage (tho not necessary all the time) and gold objective time for tanks)."
,,,,"That last one is debatable. Depending on which map you're on, how the match goes and how the game plays out, objective time can be taken with a grain of salt. You can have a rock-solid defense on Volskaya and never once touch the point."

,,,,So can Orisa really walk through her barrier to un-stick a Pulse Bomb?  Video proof?
,,,,I've definitely seen a Winston unstick a pulse bomb by walking through his barrier. I might be able to get a video if I can find it on my hard drive later!
,,,,I asked that recently and people said it's not possible. I've not been able to reproduce it either. It appears to just stick

,,,,"You cannot stack the same buff from multiple instances of the same hero.  You can get multiple different damage boosts (Mercy, Orisa, Ana) at once and those do stack."
,,,,Nope damage boosts from the same hero dont stack. So you can go Ana + Orisa + Mercy for max boost.
,,,,Jesus. How much damage
,,,,"130% boost. Pharah rockets (which normally do 120 dmg) will do 272 damage on a direct hit. Enough to oneshot Mei or Reaper, and 2-shot Winston. Widowmaker, who normally does 300 damage on a fully charged headshot, will do 690, enough to oneshot anything but an ulting Winston. Scatter arrow checks in at 1035 damage. Winston no longer stands a chance.And we haven't even begun talking about the 30% multiplicative boost from Discord yet."
,,,,Duuuuuude
,,,,Guuuuuuurl
,,,,"Can I get a quick breakdown of major changes since around the time doomfist launched? I haven't played since then. I'm not looking for every detail of a patch note, but the big things like how apparently D.va's abilities changed."

,,,,"Why, why, why, why doesn't Hanzo's stupid OP scatter arrow have the arrows break if you aim at the floor?I've had the same Hanzo twice on the enemy team that just aims his stupid scatter arrow at the floor and just one-shots me.It's such a stupid strategy that I'm sick of seeing - it takes no skill."
,,,,It's super frustrating especially when he's got recon up and you walk around a corner right into it. I think it just feels cheezy more than anything though... I'd argue that it's nearly as difficult to land consistently as a headshot. If it didn't exist you'd get headshot in those situations most of the time anyway. 
,,,,"How else would it work? If you needed a direct hit to get the scatter, the fragments won't go anywhere useful 99% of the time."
,,,,"it takes no skillIt does tho. It's significantly easier to hit than a headshot, but it's by no means no skill. No-skill instakills are Flashfag and Doomshit oneshot.Also, if that's all you're capable of as Hanzo, then you will perform very poorly."

Just a bunch of retards exploring the map.   This isn’t a choose your own adventure game.  There is one objective and it’s abundtly clear what that is.   I get through the game no big deal I’ll take the loss.  Then I’m grouped up with the same shitty ass party as before.  Neither takes healer, and we get absolutely smoked for the 2nd time in a row.  In both games I led in eliminations, damage, objective kills and healing.   How does this happen? I know what you guys are going to say.  “Get Gud”.  Well guess what, shut the fuck up.

I wish the meta would make more room for Sombra, mostly because I'm tired of being bitched at and then having to prove myself competent over and over again.Anyway, the meta likely won't experience a big shift until another character is tweaked or introduced."
,,,,"Personally, I'm hoping for Tracer buffs. Not that she needs them, I just like playing Tracer."
,,,,"At the PRO level, Sombra is a key pick. Her EMP is a great ult to start a dive on healers or the point. She's part of the current meta on certain maps / certain teams."
,,,,I know! She's an absolute DEMON on two CP maps and places like Lijang Tower because of her hacking health kits behind enemy lines and disrupting shields!But try telling that to all the lunkheads who think I don't know what I'm doing because they don't know how to play Sombra!
,,,,It’s more that her effectiveness is way higher if your team is coordinated enough to take advantage of the openings she creates.  It’s tough in PUG play.

,,,,"Requires masters rating or higherWell, see you all in 2019!"
,,,,There's no rank restrictions for Open Division? Looking at it more I don't see a rank restriction for any division.
,,,,From here: https://cdn-eslgaming.akamaized.net/misc/media/overwatch/opendivision/guides/player_path_en_nov_2017.pdfRequirements to play in the Overwatch Open DivisionPlayers who have reached 3500 in ranking (masters) or higher in the previous season of in-game ranked are eligible to play
,,,,"Oh that graphic is really old. They tried to do rank restrictions in the first season, but it didn't work. They should remove that or change it.There are no rank restrictions as you can see on the posted link.Edit: Website updated"
,,,,there's gonna be a bunch of random plat six stackers
,,,,If they win it's gonna be the memeiest team championship
,,,,"Or it'll be good proof to seemingly everybody on this sub and /r/Competitiveoverwatch that online rank means nothing. Something the FGC is already capable of knowing, for the most part.Rank, at a glance, is only good for potentially judging immediate game knowledge, but literally nothing else. "
,,,,Online rank means nothing...but I also saw Kelvin and the Chipmunks and various other streams during the first Open Division. Those poor plat six stackers. The only hope is if you are TLMO.
,,,,"Haha, yeah go win that. Rank mean something. But collectivity intelligence with bad personnal skills can also make win games. The level of play is way different at each level. Like every rank has really huge gap of levels."
,,,,Lmao it’s gonna be cute to see a bunch of plat nobodies getting their dreams crushed.  I’m a 4.1k player and even up here I can’t even touch a 4.5k player.  I don’t think you realize how much of a dramatic skill difference it is.  A 4.5k tracer is gonna solo kill your plat team.
,,,,That's just not true at all. There's plenty of videos or there to the effect of (3gms vs 6gold) and often times they even buff the GMs because it's too 1 sided in favor of the larger team. 
,,,,"Well no shit, that's a 3 v 6...A 4500+ Tracer will kill the solo with a team supporting them for sure, we're still gonna have 6v6 teams."
,,,,They hated /u/venom_god Because he told them the truth
,,,,I mean.. most teams right now are a pure joke. The amount of abandons and trolling I have seen. 
,,,,Does it have to be masters and stay in masters? What about a 400+ point fallen masters? lol
,,,,There's no rank requirement now
,,,,"that means me and a bunch of my other gold friends can get smashed, great. "
,,,,Id watch
,,,,Sweet! Now if only Blizzard gave a fuck about console players or developed for Linux. 
,,,,"Linux development isn't worth their time by a long shot, don't even dream about it.Console players could always plug a controller into a computer if they really prefer the input method."
,,,,"If I had a dollar for every time I heard that, we would have enough to fund a Linux port. As for plugging in a controller. The issue is I want to get away from the console and controller. Not use a controller on a computer. "
,,,,"It's such a small part of the market, Blizzard uses a custom engine that would need serious work to port to an linux/OSX environment, and all of these people could just install Windows 7 on a partition if they wanna play video games and be done with the issue. See Steam Machines and how well that ended.Also if you dont wanna use a controller either then why even mention console?"
,,,,Reread my original comment. You have completely missed the point. 
,,,,"Nah, I get the humour attempt but it kind of misses the mark. Granted games for linux is humor in itself."
,,,,lol
,,,,"Cool, cool. Hope a few Canadian Teams pop up sometime in the future. Would love one for my own city to be represented in the future (Calgary Cowboys? Calgary Cowboys). Wouldn't shock me if Vancouver ended up representing West Canada though :P (SureFour and a few other names aside, I have no idea how strong the competitive scene is in Canada)."
,,,,I would really like Calgary to get away from the horse theme at some point 
,,,,"I mean that would be refreshing, but being colder, gayer Texas is Alberta's whole shtick. At least cowboys and the wild west is a better theme than oil workers (it is law that I must talk shit about Edmonton).Or maybe we could go with a winter/whole other theme, who knows?"
,,,,"Gayer as in Tracer, or Gayer as in that moment you score the basketball?"
,,,,"I mean either way, we're scoring more slam dunks."
,,,,"Vancouver is to small of a market unfortunately, prob only Toronto could hold one"
,,,,"Hm, that's unfortunate to hear. I'm hoping we get at least three teams to represent Canada. One for West, one for East, and maybe a team in the middle that could also pull a few players up North (Toronto would definitely get East though, centre of the universe...).I was just assuming, you guys in BC have a lot of good sports teams, a thriving concert scene and a pretty nice chunk in the film/video game industry (last I remembered). I guess that wouldn't necessarily create a strong competitive scene for esports though. :P Here's hoping some talent begins growing there for the future then!"
,,,,"Biased as I'm from Toronto but there are only two Canadian cities that have a large enough population and that's Toronto and Vancouver.Toronto is generally seen as the preferable destination as its the hub of Canada. And aside from that, the population differential is massive, Toronto is unfortunately the only legitimate choice. I'd predict it to go just the way the Jays and Raps have, having a single Canadian team based in Toronto."
,,,,"Yeah, that's fair. Still, I can hope we get at least more than one team."
,,,,"Me and you both, I'd love 2 Canadian teams"
,,,,Apparently Toronto Esports has plans for buying a spot in S2
,,,,"a Canadian team would probably be mangachu, surefour, agilities and then people from other countries (worth noting idk the nationality of all NA players so I might've missed some)"
,,,,"Y'all can have xQc back, we don't need his crybaby attitude in Dallas"
,,,,Calgary cowboys ? I want to use profanity but I'll just say that's the silliest suggestion on the entire thread.

,,,,Will there be a LFT thread? Or should I go to r/CompetitiveOverwatch to find a team?

,,,,"I wish there was a ""2018 Path to Fixing Toxicity"" instead of the focus on eSports that will amount to as much as Hearthstone and WoW.Blizzard needs to fix the game's social problems or they won't have a game for eSports.Edit:  And downvoted right on queue.  This game and sub needs to address the real problems addressing it instead of supporting enterprises that need their support through fostering a quality community."
,,,,"Their are already games that are considered eSports atm that are cesspools, just look at:CS:GODota 2LoLThey are infamous for having terrible communities, doesn’t stop them from being a eSport or from hosting huge tournaments every year.Social problems won’t stop it."
,,,,CS had a solid competitive community prior to GO.  It was a solid foundation that Hearthstone and WoW didn't have and couldn't create.DOTA as well (although it was usurped by Valve due to Blizzard's inaction and HOTS gameplay design).LoL is the only outlier and the biggest example of other companies trying to capture lightning in a bottle again.Even Blizzard couldn't build on the SC competitive scene for SC2 eSports.Fact of the matter is Blizzard is 0-3 (soon to be 0-4) on building their eSports brand.It's in the best interests of their franchises and communities to try to correct the social and gameplay problems within those enterprises.
,,,,"All of Blizzards eSports endeavours are still very much viable and very much alive.Hearthstone, despite criticism, is still huge and tournaments have been happening ever since the game launched back in 2014, and Blizzard themselves have hosted the World Championships since 2015!WoW’s Arena scene, while small Il give you that, is still popular and while it isn’t as big as other Blizz eSports offerings, it still fills the arena at Blizzcon every year and has a sizeable backing to it, and that’s been going on since 2006!Starcraft is still huge, and while it hasn’t been in the mainstream for a while, it’s still one of the oldest and most popular eSports in the world, being publicly televised back in the early 2000’s well before CS got its footing, and Blizzard still continues to host the Finals at Blizzcon to a packed arena, and hundreds of thousands watch from home every year.Heroes follows a similar trend to WoW, but it still garners a following.Overwatch, while being new, usurped Starcraft as the main eSports game of Blizzcon 2017, taking over the main stage area that Starcraft has held for 10 years. It’s one of the most popular games in the world right now, and has had people playing it competitively since closed beta in early 2016.Calling Blizzards foray into eSports a total failure is completely wrong, and they have been doing it for longer."

,,,,"Pretty cool build, dude, she's a lucky girl! :D Just a tip, please make sure the monitor doesn't get so warm that it might start a fire with the fluff around it. Some monitors can get really warm on top\back of the unit. The D.Va fluff might act as insulation and amplify this and get dangerous. Nobody needs a house fire during Christmas. :)  Stay safe!"

,,,,that monitor cover. +1
,,,,What case is that?
,,,,Apevia Mirage-X Tempered Glass version :)
,,,,All you need now is to get her the MEKA headset by Razer.
,,,,Very cool! I have my first daughter on the way. How did you introduce her to video games? 
,,,,Well she just naturally obtained interest through seeing me and my wife play and first got into gaming with easy stuff like Mario/Little Big Planet.   I never forced it. . just hooked up some systems in the play room and let her and her sisters experiment with the games and controls.  I remember as a child playing an NES over and over until you just either loved the journey or hated the experience. . . I'm thankful we both love the journey :)

,,,,You're actually the best dad in history 
,,,,What is the mouse?

,,,,"Hey, it's me your husband, Moira gaming PC please. Thanks. Im super broke and want a Christmas present. "
,,,,Mind me asking what the specs are?
,,,,Can I be your daughter.... Sure I'm a man.. And grown.. But still my hard drive is dying and I'm willing to act. 
,,,,"Secretly he built this for himself but doesn't want to be embarrassed about being a D.VA main. Seriously though, you are an amazing dad!"

,,,,"Fucking hanzo lol, I've been behind entire walls with no los and die to a bomb but he drops 1/3 of his body below some fucking ramp and his aim is true bs "
,,,,Yeah because obviously Blizzard implemented a special secret feature that makes Hanzo more immune to explosions. /s
,,,,It's the Shimada blood line. 
,,,,"Little known fact, Hanzo and Genji each possess the sharingan"
,,,,Hanzo's arrows are bigger than his body apparently

,,,,That's gotta be a bug.
,,,,i t s a f e a t u r e
,,,,The center of the bomb makes a line with the center of your character. If something breaks the line —&gt; no damage
,,,,"That's odd. I wonder why Blizzard opted for that over the hitboxes already used in game. I'm sure it's a technical thing, or something like that."
,,,,Raytracing is hard (tm)
,,,,"How do you mean? If you mean give the explosion a hitbox, that makes it rather hard to implement being able to hide from the explosion I think."
,,,,"It doesnt seem like any of you know what a hit box is. A hit box is simply put, just more detailed collision that follows the skeleton (in this example). The players capsule is also a collider. Adding a hitbox, or collider, to an instant, AoE ability - doesn't make much sense. You could just trace towards multiple locations on the player for a more accurate check.Either way this is very intended by blizzard as it puts the favour in the potential victim. The alternative would be hypothetically dying because your toe was creeping a bit too much, which just feels shitty.The player has a good grasp of where the centre of their characters capsule is, as it is center screen. It is an easy way to check if you are safe or not in a pinch.Hazo surviving here was a biproduct of the climb animation having a lower root location, so he was out of LOS."
,,,,"What would the explosion need a hitbox for? Who's going to attack it? No no no, what I mean is use the hitboxes for the heroes. If the explosion goes off and it touches a hero's hitbox, they take the damage. It just doesn't make sense to me that the explosion could hit part of your hero and you wouldn't take the damage."
,,,,"I seem to remember a post with a Roadhog trapped with an exploding mech in that little room on the left there, and he just squatted behind the little barrel in there and was fine, even though he was watching the mech explode in his face. This explains that.Edit: Found it. Not the room I thought, but the scenario remains the same."
,,,,So it’s fine as long as the center of your body part is blocked?
,,,,"Yea, but not your characters mesh, the capsule surrounding it (used for movement collision etc)."
,,,,I’ve hid behind the payload to avoid the bomb and still get killed. What would explain that?
,,,,"When there’s no where else to run, is there room for one more son? One more son. If yah can hold on. If yah can hold on, hold on."

,,,,"now that we know there's some sort of sea monster invasion in Korea, I'm getting even more pumped in her lore "

,,,,"Michael Chu teased that Gabriel Reyes had genetic issues before contact with Moira. It seems the soldier enhancement program might be the reason for his ghostlyness, not Moira.Honestly, Chu has teased so much regarding reaper's situation. I hope that means he will get a dedicated animated short or comic soon. I want to see the whole story. "
,,,,"Theory of mine is that Reyes has stopped aging or ages very slowly if you look at the uprising comic and Moira origin story, Reyes looks younger compared to the other OG members. (however this could easily be debunked by the artist draw style though) "
,,,,"That would also explain why reaper has been around for decades, according to the online bio and Michael Chu. This might be the original 'illness' Reyes was suffering from in the soldier enhancement program. The cost would be that his cells would deteriorate from constantly maintaining his prime age. "
,,,,"I'm guessing the Gov wasn't sure how long the war was going to last so the earlier Soldiers were given sort of a youth serum to fight longer, Reyes being 24th based on the Oasis folder. I am going to speculate that one the ""random"" family in reflections is his own, so the idea of seeing his kid / friends age probably started to mess with him mentally so he recruited Moira."
,,,,"I dunno, we've had so much of Reaper in shorts and comics. Poor Dva, Lucio, and Zen have been restricted to cameos only. I'd love to see them get a short or comic each before any more."
,,,,"I REALLY want to know more about Omnics and how they function a bit more.How do they charge? Do they need to ""eat?""Where do they come from? Are there child Omnics? Do child Omnics grow up or mature?What is their average lifespan? Can they live forever?Some humans romance Omnics... how does it work? Can they even engage in sex?Female Omnics! They exist but they're only seen in posters. What's the deal?Because you can program robots to be practically perfect at everything, why can't I hit anything as Zenyatta?"
,,,,"Some humans romance Omnics... how does it work? Can they even engage in sex?Jude Law says hello ;)Female Omnics! They exist but they're only seen in posters. What's the deal?Does Orissa count?Also, maybe it's just me, but I assumed all the robots we fought in Uprising were female apart from the OR14 and Bastion units. I will throw my hands up and confess that might just be based on the color schemes."
,,,,"Orisa TECHNICALLY counts, but she's basically an OR15 unit. The Omnics I'm referring to are the ones you see trying to fit into society."
,,,,"I've just assumed that there's no discernable difference between ""male"" and ""female"" omnics, other than voices. It also seems like most postwar omnics are all the same model/type, so the writers aren't super interested in introducing 4 or 5 characters who all look exactly alike except for clothing."
,,,,"Blizzardworld actually has a poster depicting a child omnic(1st choke on defender side), which makes very little sense considering omnics are entirely robotic, we dont know how they are made or how they function. Another thing that bugged me was they all look the same(not omnicist i have many omnic friends) except for the child omnic at blizzworld, the Numbani fashion model, Athena in concept art and Hollywood movie poster(which may just be stylized).I wish we could get some omnic lore, so many unanswered questions."
,,,,"Reaper's physically been in a lot of shorts and comics, yes, but as far as his story goes he's still basically stuck in the museum in 2014. Which is especially a problem in his case because he's the primary antagonist of OW, and is supposed to be a complex character (especially pre-breakup), but as far as we still know is just a sociopathic asshole. "
,,,,"It has seemed very likely that is the case, especially since Moira's release. Reyes had issues from S.E.P., Moira helped weaponize those issues as well as keeping them under control, and also applied the results of that research to herself to create her life-sucking arm, fade jumps, etc. Items in Oasis University indicate she is still working on resolving the original issue for Reaper.I would go a step further and say that if Reaper had these genetic issues from S.E.P., maybe the appearances of ""Reaper"" in battlefields for decades, as described in his hero profile, may be related to the other soldiers in the program. Since Jack was a later participant (Soldier:76) he's not affected.No one left behind :("
,,,,If that's true I'll be pretty disappointed. I'm really tired of them putting out content and then Chu deciding to change the lore. It makes it even harder for the fanbase to actually put together information from the scraps they've handed us 
,,,,He's the head writer. He's not rewriting the characters. I don't know where you are pulling that from. 
,,,,Blizzard: Puts out contentCommunity: Ohhh so that must mean this right!?Chu: Nah it actually means thisCommunity: Fuck you chu our version was better
,,,,Isn't it literally Chu's job to dictate the lore?
,,,,He's the main writer lol he's not changing anything what he says goes
,,,,"""Orisa really looks up to Reinhardt... a lot of her emotes and poses are a sort of call out to Reinhardt.""The devs also joke that Efi and Orisa watch old Overwatch videos in the lab together and that's what has inspired them."

,,,,Hit me right in the feelers
,,,,"TIL Roadhog used to own a farm, and the first Doomfist (aka the Savior) was actually a hero during the Omnic Crisis."
,,,,I believe Roadhog's farm is the first attacker's spawn on Junkertown.
,,,,I don't know about that. It appears in one of the comics and seems pretty isolated if I'm remembering correctly.
,,,,"It's right outsise of Junkertown, the pit is there really only for gameplay purposes I imagine. Certainly more interesting than a fence or an invisible wall."
,,,,Thanks for the lore and behind the scenes insight Mr. Canon Man!Basically reads off D.Va's known backstoryDammit ;-;
,,,,Better than just saying that Junkrat is missing a leg and has hair on fire
,,,,Forgot the inconsistent voice actor name drops.
,,,,One day there'll be more
,,,,"So what you're saying is that more D.Va lore is coming someday, somehow, Michael will make it all right but not right now?"
,,,,I just hope we see more but I doubt it will be soon
,,,,"Yeah, lore for this game is released glacially slowly. Some heroes have nothing more than the backstory on the website, and the majority haven't been seen in anything since Reflections a goddamn year ago."
,,,,"I think dva, Lucio and symmetry are the main ones missing stand alone stories mostly"
,,,,"Symmetra has the comic A Better World, which gives us some great insight into her character.IMO, the characters that are currently lore-starved are:D.Va - literally nothing besides her backstoryHanzo - appeared in Dragons, but we learned nothing much about himLúcio - has nothing but his backstoryMcCree - he had a comic, but it had nothing significant in itMei - her short was just a depiction of her already known backstoryMercy - has nothing but her backstoryOrisa - nothing since her releasePharah - her comic gave us some good world lore but nothing about Pharah herselfWidowmaker - despite all her appearances, she hasn't gotten any real focus since Alive, which only really told us that she once killed a prominent Omnic, but that's not much considering we already knew she's an assassinZenyatta - has nothing but his backstory10 of 26 characters have practically nothing, and even more have only a tiny bit of story. Lore for this game is slow and constantly heaped upon the same small group of characters."
,,,,Sym has a comic. Zenyatta doesn't.
,,,,I honestly wasn't aware sun had a comic. Thank you f9r letting me know
,,,,When Blizzard canceled the graphic novel they essentially said they don't want to do anything to disprove any fan theories or ideas. So don't expect there to ever be any progress on the games lore. I used to really be into the world of Overwatch but now I've lost all interest since the devs aren't willing to ever make anything actually happen or change in the story. 
,,,,I also hope they just don't follow the fan canon and make her into a walking gamer meme that's in love with Lucio. Poor girl has probably seen some shit.
,,,,Give her a decent story like the meme being a facade for the destruction she's seen in South Korea 
,,,,"I mean you don't have to make her a Netflix show character or Tumblr OC where her trauma defines every aspect of her, but I'm sure it has taken a toll on her somehow.I mean look at Mei, she seems like a happy person despite being frozen for ten years, waking up to find her friends dead and seeing Overwatch disbanded."
,,,,"But she is a walking gamer meme... She's literally only piloting her MEKA because she's a gamer. Her voicelines ""this is for my fans"" and ""this is my kind of city! Lights, camera, action!"" have been in the game since day 1, not to mention her gaming related voice lines you can pick."
,,,,"Oh yeah don't get me wrong I enjoy all of that, but hopefully they expand on her character and show that she's more than that."
,,,,"Gotcha. I sure hope so too. It's sad to see my main get so much merchandise (that Dva headset, nnf) but no short :("
,,,,Its not a surprise she is just not especially connected to the main plot and her young age doesn't help her much. Main mover and shakers are all roughly 30+
,,,,Jiro Dreams of Sushi was a great documentary
,,,,I really liked that documentary. A thrilling ride
,,,,"There was some Zenyatta footage at the end...That's not official stuff, is it?"
,,,,Nope https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35sk26iKa9g
,,,,TIL Bastion is actually voiced by someone (Chris Metzen?). Wow.
,,,,The biggest reveal from this video.
,,,,"i'm really tired of picking lore crumbs in interviews, short movies, short comics, maps, etc... plz 2018, give me at least a book about any part of the lore... I need some piece of midia with more than  10 minutes of dedicated time"
,,,,I feel like this game has been out far too long to have this little lore. At this point I highly doubt we'll ever get anything significant.
,,,,"This was horribly edited. The explanations were inconsistent. Either talking about their back stories or talking about their development game-wise. Or just full on horrible and just explaining their design then dropping in a choppy edited in , "" Voiced by..."" (Ex. Junkrat) Wired had the Dude behind the creation of the story and they couldn't' spend 10 minutes thinking about what format they wanted?"
,,,,"This isn't a great video. Basically, for anyone familiar with Overwatch the information is too surface level and most of it is stuff everybody already knows. For people who aren't familiar with Overwatch, he doesn't explicitly explain enough of the Overwatch backstory or how the heroes relate to each other on a more general level to make any of the info interesting/relevant. It seems like they needed to pick a specific group of people to target this to and then go for explanations at that level."
,,,,"Just watching. Anything new?Admittedly this is an interview for Wired, so it is primarily how that publication wanted to interview I guess.Also,  it's probably more of a mainstream piece not specifically fan or community targeted."
,,,,"But that's kinda my point. If it's targeted towards a wider audience who aren't familiar with Overwatch, then it makes perfect sense to spend time explaining the relationship between Hanzo/Genji or Ana/Pharah. But if that's who you are targeting, then you need to explain what the Omnic Crisis is, what the bad guys and good guys are fighting over, what Overwatch is as an organization, etc. They never even spend 10 seconds of backstory for Overwatch in general and he uses terms that you and I would be familiar with but a general audience wouldn't.For example, they introduce Zenyatta as an Omnic Munk. But they never explain what an Omnic is and they never explain whether the Omnic's are good or bad (or what relevance they have to the Overwatch story). You get from context that there was a war against the Omnic's so the casual observer would assume that Zen is a bad guy, probably. It's just never really clear what audience they are trying to explain the Overwatch characters to. It never get in depth enough to target people who play the game but it's all too confusing and insubstantial enough to target people who haven't played it."
,,,,"A wide audience, maybe? If I were doing an interview about a lore then I would explain some well known but interesting facts for oblivious audience, leave out certain things which a fan already knows but someone else might get curious about and begin to look it up, and also throw in some juicy never-heard-before details that resonate really only with hardcore lore fans. Personally I think it's written to appeal to as many people as possible with various range of the world knowledge."
,,,,"I don't really see what you're saying. If I didn't know what Overwatch was about, nothing in this video helped me understand or made me interested in figuring it out for myself. Giving some backstory about what Overwatch is actually about could have helped accomplish that. It would have made you care about the difference between the good guys and bad guys, or find the backstory of the different heroes interesting. As it stands in this video, I don't understand how any of the heroes relate to each other (outside of the individual family relationships that were explained). All I got from it is that there are a wide variety of different heroes. There's a cowboy, and a rocket lady, and a gorilla from the moon, etc. The fact that there was a huge war, and destruction to much of the planet, and competing organizations is mostly lost on me unless I already know about it."
,,,,"The only significant new things I noticed (assuming I didn't miss them being said elsewhere) were that Mercy left Overwatch on her own even before it was shut down, Reaper recruited Moira because he had some genetic issues he wanted worked on, and the first Doomfist was a hero during the Omnic Crisis."
,,,,"I dunno, I know already know a lot about the game's lore and still enjoyed it, and found a few new things about it here and there."
,,,,"Interesting, however I find it weird that he talks so much about trivia and not that much about the writing. I liked the section about Orisa and Rein, those felt more in depth. The rest is very surface level."
,,,,not much new but i love the fact that there is a vault of tracer giggles somewhere out there. also i get the feeling that an event where overwatch has to face the giant mecha-kaiju for korea would be the coolest thing ever
,,,,So I'm guessing the next cinematic is for Zenyatta? Or were the background clips of him and a wounded Genji already seen somewhere before?
,,,,"That's from a fan-made animated short in SFM, actually.EDIT: Link"
,,,,"Ah, very nice of them to have used it for this video then :)Though that means no guaranteed Zen cinematic next :'("
,,,,That was great 
,,,,"Well it wasn't as much as I was expecting, but interesting nonetheless. I think my favourite titbit is that a cooking show of all places inspired the Genji/Hanzo story. "
,,,,Jiro Dreams of Sushi is a documentary and a surprisingly good one at that.
,,,,My ggochu LOL
,,,,Funny that they used clips from a fan Zenyatta/Genji short.
,,,,That's because Zenyatta has no lore.
,,,,"Me: Aw yeah, finally some more information about D.Va!Micheal: talks about korea(;n;"
,,,,All I want for Christmas is lore
,,,,"Huh, I was used to the idea of hard light after playing Halo, so I had just assumed it was a common sci-fi thing when Symmetra was using it, too. "
,,,,"Im dying look at D.Va on his shirt, looks like she's just a head with legs lmao"
,,,,Wow Junkrat really gets the short end of the stick in this
,,,,Commenting for later.
,,,,you can save posts
,,,,"Came on here surprised to see this. I was really hoping it'd be full of new lore bits, especially for some heroes lacking in it, since it seemed like a prime opportunity. Didn't really get that, though. Which is fine, I guess: that wasn't promised to me, I was just hoping for it. There were a few notable new pieces of info about heroes in the lore, as well as some interesting stories regarding hero development and the voice actors, but that's about it. More suited for someone casually into Overwatch than someone really invested in it. "

,,,,Enviromental kills dont count as damage apparently :( 
,,,,"And, lo, Orisa didst get screwed on environmental kills again."
,,,,I was just wondering that. 
,,,,That achievement is pretty easy to get. Just shoot the halt into a big grav before the follow up. It's kinda cheap but if you want the spray that's an easy way to get it
,,,,A big grav? What do you mean?
,,,,"Nice job! Was it planned and communicated with Orisa, or just a lucky coincidence that she used her Graviton Surge at the right time?"
,,,,"Lucky as all hell. I came around the top looking for the boop regardless, but she just set it up perfectly."
,,,,"Uhm excuse me gracirin surge is zaryas ultimate ability, orisas right click is quite clearly super sticky snot shot "
,,,,This is satisfying to watch
,,,,Sorry I'm confused what did orisa  actually do?
,,,,She brought them all together into a cluster using her right-click (halt) which I believe would also disable their momentum making them easier for Pharah to knockback.
,,,,"Partly what /u/LeviW said, but Orisa grouped all four of em together, which let me boop them really reliably. Based on their pre-halt positions, I would have gotten maybe two of them, tops."

,,,,"Hi all, I'm the author of this guide. I had originally written it for /r/overwatchuniversity (but had also always intended for /u/vandalmunroe to use it for his website) and people there were saying that 'communication is a net negative,' so I wrote a 'small' edit to my original post. I'll copy it here in case anyone wants to read that as well. In the comments, some people have been saying that they have felt that communicating only tends to tilt people. This can be because of a variety of things. Those people could have already been tilted and are venting their frustrations on the 'tryhard' (shouldn't we all be tryharding in competitive?) for example. It could also be that the player who is communicating is being too condescending or argumentative about it (often without realizing it) even though they do mean well. Then there is also the fact that some people are just playing their own game and have next to zero interest in actually working with their team, which (to me) is entirely the wrong way of going about a competitive OW game.If you queue up in competitive (which is by all accounts the most 'serious' way of playing the game for most players) in Overwatch, which is a multiplayer only team based game, I think that there should be a certain willingness to be a team player and work with your team. I am not saying that people should be playing heroes they really don't want to play or have no playtime on and be the lackey of their team, but there is a middle ground between that and blatantly ignoring the input of your team and just doing whatever the hell you want, including getting mad when someone does want to work as a team. This is partially covered in the 'mind your attitude' part of the guide though.Either way: it is important to get a feel for your team. If a certain player really doesn't handle your suggestion to switch off well then it's probably best to leave it at that, for example. Millions of people play this game and as such there's tons of different personality types behind those screens. Much as in real life it's important that you are able to 'read the room'.It is also possible to 'force yourself' on your team too hard. It is fine to communicate regular stuff (basic health callouts, ults, ...) but if you try to babysit your team a little too hard then there's a possibility that that doesn't sit well with the enemy team. Remember that no one elected you as their leader, so it's not your responsibility to steer the team and have all of them play to your ideas. If you are calling the shots a bit and people are listening and agreeing, then great, keep doing that. But if you feel like your team wants to go a different route then go along with the team. It's a team game, there is no set hierarchy, you're all on the same level of the leadership pyramid.There is also definitely the possibility that you are communicating too much. As with almost anything, moderation is key. There's no need to call out that McCree used his roll when he exited spawn, or that Tracer used one blink, for example. Aside from that, some groups of people naturally prefer a more laid back style of comms (just saying whatever is really necessary) whilst some will have no problem with a more 'professional' style of communication. Again; reading the room is important.Edit conclusionI don't want to pull any rank card or sound like a grandpa, but I've been playing competitive games for the better part of a decade now and communication is something which leads to good results (or at least causes no extra troubles) 95% of the time in my opinion. It's definitely very important to 'read the room' when you're playing with randoms though, and that is a skill that will come with time. Some people are 'beyond help' (people who are already tilted from a loss streak, very selfish/arrogant players, trolls, ...) but that's just the nature of people, that's not a downside of communicating in itself.It is important to also look at yourself as well. If you find that more than half of your teammates get angry with you after a while then it's probably best to take a look at how exactly you're communicating. No matter how well you mean it, you could be coming off as a smug bastard to them or you could be yelling stuff which really doesn't matter at all.All in all I firmly believe that being able to communicate properly (which also means knowing what you can and can't say to certain teammates and so on) is a very valuable skill. You don't have to be talking all the time (I don't do that either) and as with everything there are nuances to it. You're playing with real people with real feelings and personalities after all, not with robots. Some people prefer to be silent and just listen in and that's fine as well, but I wholeheartedly disagree with the notion that getting on comms somehow always (or the majority of the time) has a negative effect on your team. That doesn't rhyme with my experiences and it doesn't rhyme with what I see on the streams I watch every day either."
,,,,Good stuff! 
,,,,I have a genuine question: What's your opinion on not being in VC?I recently started doing this after I fell 300 SR in one day due to Ego/Stubborn/Toxic people. Don't I just don't want to talk to anyone anymore.and usually what comes out of this that I cost us the game for lack of comms. Not to be egotistic myself but I have good game sense and understand game mechanics and play well. Am I good? that's another question.and the only reason I did start doing this is because I read a top post on here the other day that leaving voice chat helps you have a better game due to the cut off from the chatter.P.S what also doesn't help is that I play off meta heros. so people assume i'm throwing.
,,,,"I am not against people who don't talk themselves. I'm of the opinion that it's always better to at least make super necessary callouts (like a flanking Reaper with ult or whatever who hasn't been seen by anyone in your team) but I understand that there are people who'd rather not talk due to a variety of reasons. Completely shutting off the chat of other people by default is something which I think is rather silly though. Initially it might help you to focus on your game if you just turn everything off, but remember that OW is a team game and you team's input can genuinely mean the difference between winning or losing a game.I also think that being able to listen to team chat whilst playing the game is a skill which needs to be trained before you can do it perfectly. If it's really so beneficial to just mute everything then why don't pro teams do that, for instance? Another comment on here went something along the lines of 'how is communicating with my team gonna help me win a 1v1 with a flanker' and the answer is that it won't help you win that 1v1 in that instance (though communicating it may save your life due to someone peeling for you or whatever) but to me that's a bit of a lazy (I don't mean that offensively) way of thinking. For example; I play soccer. Why would I try to look up at the field as often as possible when running with the bal when I can just look at my feet the entire team, making it way easier? This just to say that, yes, it might be easier to look at your feet, but you'll lose valuable info on the position of your teammates and the opposition. Once you've practiced enough it becomes second nature to look up as much as possible as opposed to looking at your feet.The same goes for OW. Yeah, it might be easier to shut everything off and 'just focus on your own play' but that comes at the cost of not hearing possible gamesaving calls, not being able to call out very important stuff which can win you games, ... I've been gaming for a long time and now I can easily talk and listen to other players without it being a major hindrance to me. You can look at players like Emongg if you want an example of a player who is constantly talking and listening and still performing very well. Now of course if your team consists of a bunch of trolls blaring music and farting noises through their mics whilst raging at each other then you can turn it all off, but I think shutting off communications entirely by default isn't the right way to go. TL;DR: I'd say shutting off all comms by default is a mistake. It might be easier for you to play without all of these 'distractions' but once you get used to it it's not a distraction any longer. Perhaps a silly example to illustrate my point: it's easier to ride a bike with training wheels because you're not being distracted by the whole 'trying to stay upright' thing, but if you want to become a decent/pro cyclist you're gonna have to take off the training wheels sooner or later."
,,,,This is really well done!
,,,,"I had a couple amazing games last night with a great team that really played a great game and the communication was great. the funny part of all this is that I was the only one in voicechat....I felt like I was really leading the team and they were listening to everything I said and all stuck to the gameplan I put forth. Probably my funnest games I have ever played in comp.Before the rounds I seen we went the basic 2/2/2 comp right off the bat which was great!! So I told the flanker to flank the team and the rest stick together behind our Rein and they all said ""understood"" with the quick msgs.Then when we started I made all the callouts of the enemy flankers and my tanks helped me out Rein saved me several times. Oh forgot to mention I was playing Moira.Also I stuck to being positive through the whole match thanking for the heals from our Mercy of Lucio, (they swapped for some rounds). Thanked the tanks for blocking for me. Everyone used the quick msg to thank me or say understood which made me aware they were listening and loved my strategy and callouts.I ended the first match only dying once and had 30 elims. the second match I had 40 elims and only died 3 times. We swept both matches, getting 3 checkpoints when the other teams never reached the first checkpoint.So to add to your write up, even if you are not communicating yourself. At least go in to team chat to listen in case someone else is in there to help by making callouts etc. It helps a ton!"
,,,,"A lot of times it seems a healer is best for making callouts because of already needing to be extremely aware of what's happening on all sides, and because they can see teammate silhouettes through walls, they can more easily see where each teammate is (instead of 'someone's over there, but I can't tell who or how far)."
,,,,"I have question, what If I am afraid using the mix, because I do not naturally speak english (I speak slovak language normally) and  I am afraid if I would use mic, people would not understand me, or understand me in different (negative) way I did not intended to be.What If I say word that is not bad/offensive, but my teammates would hear it negative (overhear my word and confuse it with other words)?Second, it is soo rarely to find a person who speaks on mic in game and EVEN that not everyone speaks english. I heard russian language spoken on mic. (And other language I dont know where they come from.)Third issue is, when I hear people speak english on mic, I have hard time understand what they say because they are silent, swole the words or speak them too fast. During battle its like solving puzzle."
,,,,"I think it's not that big of a deal. If they can't understand your accent don't get embarassed, it's just life. They won't be mad that you're trying. With that said, you can probably do just fine with at least short phrases, especially calling enemy positions. Even with a heavy accent, most people will probably understand ""Reaper above"" or ""Tracer behind"" and that is some of the most important baseline communication. "
,,,,Thank you for answering my problem!Appreciated!
,,,,"also, using comms is a great way to practice! so you'll get better over time probably"
,,,,"i recently got  a new desktop and didnt have a mic. Entered this game where some dude was playing music and acting happy and shit (like ew right?) And i almost left the channel, but he wasnt hindering anything so i stayed. Beginning of 2nd round, hes fucking singing, then tells me to take it away. Well first of all i dont know the song and second of all i have no mic. So i do the next best thing. I leave the channel. I join back in about 10 seconds and theyre all laughing and told me ""nice memes""By far my favorite match"
,,,,"Anyone else remember when PvPTwitch (famed Junk main, not OTP) started out? He had recently switched from console to PC and almost every game on console is played open mic.  He DID NOT want to make the switch to push to talk initially. Got complaints almost every game. It was awkward to watch. I’m guessing the thought of having to interrupt yourself with pressing the button was non-intuitive and just not something he wanted to get used to. He was already in high level play.  I mean it will get you killed from time to time and me and him made the same transition so I know the glorious freedom of open mic. He was calm on comms, made call outs, switched when needed. He didn’t defend his main (seen as viable only on select maps at the time...Eich, Dorado defense etc...) — he sold him.  The attempt he made was to not create a toxic or hopeless atmosphere at the beginning of the game JUST because of his pick.  I only watched a few of his streams in the super early days so thats what i’m basing this off of. I was wondering if someone who was not already established or a pro ever had a chance of making it. FWIW I left thinking “he’s trying too hard” (to make it.) Welp.But anyways, imagine instalocking Junk and not saying a word back then. You just communicated ALOT and it wasn’t good.  I just wrote way too much but there are a few things about communication in there. "
,,,,I was an open mic Halo 3 player for years and made the switch to PC.  Console is only open mic so getting used to PTT is not easy.  This article has good advice about having the mute button close at hand.
,,,,"Seems like a long way of saying ""Tell Hanzo to switch and then blame him if you lose anyway.""Seriously though, I feel like the community, in general, can communicate reasonably well; but where things fall apart is when it comes to assessing the game/situation. It's unfortunately so incredibly common for people to scapegoat someone else or blame some outside force, get tilted and babyrage all over voice or text. I've watched so many games go from our favor to auto-loss due to people getting triggered after losing a team fight because they didn't get healed, or &lt;most off-meta hero&gt; didn't last-hit everyone so they don't show up in the kill feed or something stupid like that.I suppose reeling that in is part of the communication thing (and something you touch on), but it'd be rad if people would control those emotions entirely and not tilt at all."
,,,,"All my previous attempts to use a mic over the years resulted in unidentifiable human (?) noises, screaming kids, bad hiphop music or strangers shouting angry words at other strangers. In fact, the first thing I’ll do when joining any online game is muting everybody so I can focus on the game. "
,,,,I actually started climbing again when I began to mute all the text and voice chats. Communication can help you win a game but talking and listening to the team distracted me so I couldn't really focus on what actually makes you climb. Not just winning games but improving yourself because that is what the skill rating represents.For example I won't learn how to beat a flanker by making a call out while losing focus on aiming. It might be easier for others to multitask talking/listening and playing but personally it helped me a lot to stop me from thinking more about what to say than about what to do.But note that I am playing flex support (all 5 healers) and therefore mostly don't need to communicate while picking a hero and also have enough information about my teams positioning because I can see their silhouettes.Another aspect is that you lose out on all the toxicity that might occur but of course also on all the opportunities to talk to awesome people which is one of the best parts of Overwatch.

He said that shotcalling for support is like one of the most important things to do since you are mostly standing in the backline and have the best overview. I honestly think that the biggest reason for me to ever leave plat and make it to masters is my shotcalling. My aim is not what it was like when i was younger and my gamesense is far from perfect but my shotcalling is pretty close to how this articel describes it. Realy an underappreciated part of the game!"
,,,,"I was expecting a joke!Goddamn you for making a ""Serious!"" post and getting my hopes up that someone will actually read it so when I say ""group up with me"" as Moira, people will stop trickling in one at a time."
,,,,Yeah the guide is great and the amount of detail is really helpful even if you think that you already communicate well. The only problem is that you almost never have enough people on voice chat (let alone talking people). I actually think that preferring people that at least listen to the calls even if they dont have a mic. This should be done even if you lost the game.
,,,,"Mind your attitude. As a general rule of thumb you should try to never react to something and let your frustration shine through. Creating a bad vibe in a team is the shortest way to a loss, because tilted people will always play worse. If your Mercy blatantly missed your multiple calls for healing and you were standing right next to her then you have every right to be a little upset, but don't let it shine through in your comms too much. It's okay to tell someone you think they did something wrong (and you should be able to take constructive criticism as a player in a competitive game mode) but never resort to flaming or any sort of abuse. There are people who are able to shrug stuff like that off, but mostly you will only generate an equally hostile response or cause people to start playing worse (i.e. 'tilting' them) and that is the shortest way to a loss.This is the most important piece of advice out the entire post. I've played way to many games where someone will mess up one tiny thing and people will instantly start to flame and tilt off of it. At the end of the day, its a game and we're all trying to have fun. Flaming others and becoming tilted over small mistakes shows you aren't mature enough to play in a competitive environment. "

,,,,"When I first started playing Overwatch, I went into options and turned off voice chat/volume. Haven't turned it on since."
,,,,"I have a friend that says he does callouts and talks with the team and all that jazz.  He is currently in Plat and is struggling to get to Diamond.  For a bit, I had an alt account that could play with him before it reached diamond and out of his range.What I noticed when I was playing with him was that he was talking, but it wasn't anything useful.  Saying things like ""It's okay, we'll get them next time."" or ""Don't worry, we're doing good."" doesn't really help.  It's good to stay positive, but if that's all you're saying, then you are not helping your team really.  Like OP said, you need specific callouts to direct your team, not to keep morale up.So, if you are claiming that you are talking and trying to help, it might be good to take note of what you're saying.  Does it actually help the team?  If not, then reconsider what you think is a useful callout."

,,,,"I only really get it on PS4 when playing mystery heros (I think because skipping the hero select screen doesn't give it time to load the models properly). If it gets worse to the point of anything like this, I'd consider replacing my HD with an SSD."
,,,,It only started behaving like this since the Halloween update and other games aren’t doing anything out of the ordinary 
,,,,"It's been getting a little worse over the time, I think it's the way they designed the loading of the models and maybe there's something now that there are more heros and more skin and models that it has to deal with that what worked before is no longer optimized, or maybe there were some other changes that put a kink in the system, but over the past few updates it's gotten a bit worse. Though still I mostly notice it in mystery heroes."

,,,,I'm not sure how to check

,,,,"4 years isn't too bad, assuming you bought new hardware at the time.  2013 was about Haswell time, so if you are running an i5/i7 from that era (3570/3770/4670/4770) you probably just need a new GPU and a SSD (if you don't have one.)  I just upgraded my 4770 + 770gtx to a 4770 + 1060gtx, gave windows a fresh install, and it honestly feels like a new system."
,,,,"Yea, im running a 4670k and GTX 760, game runs fine. I think its mainly an issue with slower hard drives. They might be running the game off the drive which houses their Windows which could cause loading issues if it isnt a higher end HDD or a SSD."

,,,,"Well yeah the problem isn't the game but this wasn't happening to me a month ago and it went from a few seconds to actually having you sit in spawn to wait for your character to load, it's impacting gameplay a lot specially in deathmatch and comp games that last longer so you spend less time in spawn after a round "
,,,,[deleted]
,,,,Blizzard said this is an actual issue they're looking into though
,,,,Well I don’t know then. I am a PC player and I had bad internet at one point and this was a cause of it. I got a new router and everything was fixed.
,,,,The models aren't downloaded over the internet. It's the rate (and the order) that the data is loaded off the hard drive.
,,,,NA

,,,,So hilarious

,,,,Oi! You turned Moira into modern art!
,,,,Savage!
,,,,NA
,,,,NA
,,,,"Considering coffee is poisonous to birds, this is just tragedy waiting to happen"
,,,,"That's a teacup, not a coffee mug."
,,,,"Still poisonous, they both have caffeine."
,,,,It's hot cocoa (holiday themed). How about now?
,,,,Useless fact of the day: There's actually caffeine in hot cocoa too. 
,,,,"Another useless fact: Theobromine, the compound that makes chocolate so, is almost molecularly identical to caffeine. It is classified as a stimulant, but is absorbed by the body much less efficiently. Interestingly enough, there are some teas that contain theobromine."
,,,,So y’all mothasuckas just determined to kill this damn bird huh?
,,,,Yes
,,,,And isn't chocolate poisonous to birds as well? I know that cats and dogs cant eat it so it would make sense that birds can't either. 
,,,,"Why, because birds are so similar to cats and dogs?^(I actually have no idea I’m just being facetious)"
,,,,"I was thinking weak stomach, but now that you say it yes very similar indeed. Have you never heard a bird bark or meow? They are the same I tell ya."
,,,,"But have you not heard a bird sing? And who else sings? Thats right, humans. Therefor birds are humans"
,,,,"Yes, chocolate is poisonous to birds."
,,,,Who’s to say it isn’t just water in there? Not like Bastion is going to drink it. 
,,,,Still poisonous. Water is poisonous to birds too. 
,,,,Poor ducks!!!
,,,,There's tea that doesn't have caffeine.
,,,,/r/nofunallowed
,,,,Not all tea is caffeinated 
,,,,Berry tea- no caffeine there.
,,,,Depends on the brand/sort of tea.
,,,,Maybe it's herbal tea
,,,,Here in Denmark we typically drink coffee from cups and tea from mugs. I never really thought about it before now.
,,,,"I don't think Bastion would drink coffee or tea either, notice how there is no steam coming out, so no hot beverage. I see him as a humble robot that tries to please everyone, so he just filled it with water to keep Ganymede hydrated."
,,,,I'm guessing this will be the official reasoning for Ganymede drinking it. It's just a cup of nice cool water for him since Bastion doesn't need the drink.
,,,,its minecraft all over again (Feeding Parrots cookies used to heal them even though chocolate is poisonous to them)
,,,,All you guys think a robot drinks tea and coffee. That's pure motor oil in there. 
,,,,Motor oil isn't good for electronic systems. It's more likely to be coolant.
,,,,the cup is filled with molten snowflakes. bastion drinks nothing. ganymede is washing himself.
,,,,How about owls and roosters?
,,,,Now I know the fact that Bastion having the same type of cup as Ana is likely due to re-using assets. But I'd LIKE to believe that she gave him one for the holidays instead. :-)
,,,,"That means Ana, still pretending to be a dead woman, visited Torbjorn and saw that he made a robot friend and gifted robot friend a teacup. Which also means she just randomly carries around teacups to give people who think she’s dead. I love it. "
,,,,"Ganymede found Ana and acquired the cup, why would bastion need a tea cup? He’s a robot.Explains the Corsair skin, Ganymede stayed with Ana for a while."
,,,,Ana knows bastion doesn’t need a teacup but she knows a death robot with a bird friend would probably appreciate a teacup 
,,,,This makes my Secret Santa mark a lot easier to shop for.
,,,,You are thinking with human. You should think with portal omnics instead.Ana gifted a bird holding complex/mobile bird living quarters to Bastion.
,,,,"Easy, she just dressed up as Santa to not blow her cover. "
,,,,"""robot, do you know cuphead?"" ana asked as she placed her teacup on bastions head. she later would forget the teacup still resting on the bastions head. a new friend was made, and ganymede liked it"
,,,,im frustrated at their lack of effort :/ still waiting for that teacup icon too
,,,,Doesn't Roadhog also have this cup?
,,,,i think roadie has one with a special maori design on it uwu
,,,,Wait how would we get this before the event ends if it’s on PTR?
,,,,"Everyone will get the pose after Winter wonderland ends, more info here - https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760696771#post-1"
,,,,Oh that’s very cool of them. How does the Sombra’s pose look?
,,,,Here is Sombra's new Toast pose - https://i.imgur.com/SStdyyg.jpg
,,,,"That's the same mug that Soldier 76 has!  My god!, what does it mean!??!!/s"
,,,,Sombra is obviously Soldier's half mother. That is the reason why she's always hiding - she didn't want him to know. When she gave him away she only left him with the same mug she is holding here.
,,,,Reminds me of the story of Spy from TF2.
,,,,So what was the story of the spy? I stopped following tf2 years ago
,,,,She hacked his mug.Obviously. 
,,,,"EVERYTHING can be hacked, and everyone."
,,,,Better check for Sombra clues!
,,,,she stole it
,,,,Lol she pourin' out one for the homies? Maybe her nog is super dense?
,,,,Thank you
,,,,"Thats less ""toast"" and more like ""limply holding mug"""
,,,,they should fix sombra's pumpkin pose while they are at it cause her neck looks 7 foot long
,,,,"Sombra could have had a hologram cup and as someone else mentioned bastion holds oil, it would be awesome if they could ninja this in before they release it just because it seems a tad under blizzards quality standard reusing assets like this, even if these poses weren't originally meant to be put in the game."
,,,,Holy shit the Overwatch team knows how to treat its community well.
,,,,Meanwhile at r/DestinyTheGame
,,,,HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGH
,,,,"I love how everyone loved Ana’s teacup, so now everyone gets a teacup!"
,,,,"I like the idea that Ana and Bastion are now friends because of Ganymede, and she let Bastion borrow her cup. "
,,,,I was waiting for him to turn into a toaster. 
,,,,Came here to say this.Was very disappointed.
,,,,Aw man no motor oil? Missed opportunity
,,,,I'd be up for oil but I think it might be harmful for birds...
,,,,"So that's why they didn't use Bastion pose... they were probably unhappy with Ganymede's animation, or it was too buggy. Maybe they didn't want to use the same asset (Roadhog's toast cup has same shape but different pattern). Sombra's cup probably didn't look ""Sombra"" enough, in fact it's also a reused asset from Soldier's victory pose."
,,,,"Yeah, if you take a closer look at Ganymede's tail it looks like it's been cut in half (probably because of clipping issues), it looks a little weird though.If they didn't show this victory pose in advertisements I don't think this pose would of ever made it into the game. (I'm glad it did because I really like it)"
,,,,"I like it a lot too, I'm just surprised that both the poses and the Hanzo skin were first put to PTR instead of straight to the game. Maybe they want to further tweak them when they get the time?"
,,,,"console issues, friend;extended patching process--also, holidays"
,,,,"It's possible they could be placeholder assets.Well, Sombra's at least, I think Bastion's cup may definitely stay given they'd have to adjust Ganymede too if they changed it."
,,,,"In animation the main concept is having separate ""snapshots"" called keyframes that remembers where each bone is, and the program displaying the animation moves the bones inbetween each keyframe smoothly.It can do this in a variety of speeds. A bezier curve that is slow at the start then moves towards the next keyframe faster as it gets closer produces an effect that is very satisfying for say, a blacksmith striking his metal or other organic movements.Bastion in this case is a jittery robot, it is very likely that they used linear(constant speed) speeds inbetween each keyframe to fit the animation style better.The bird being in the same animation, (in theory) is being affected by this linear timing, making it seem like horrible animation when its actually just a limitation of the animation.the more you knowtm"
,,,,"While you're right about a lot of things, correct me if I'm wrong but current industry standard isn't to animate directly to the model, but animate on a rig and then bake every frame of that animation back to the skeleton. In a behind the scenes kinda video I remember seeing the animator for Mei  using Maya, and in Maya there's nothing restricting you from using linear curves on bastion and bezier curves on Genymedesp?. In fact, you don't even need a single control to be entirely linear or bezier or any other type of curve. A lot of bastions parts are clearly done using actual curves I  fact."
,,,,"You're absolutely right, Maya has plenty of tools that allow for mixed curves and even custom curve plotting, and yes it is baked into a file that Overwatch and its engine uses.But ultimately it comes down to whether Overwatch engine supports mixed curves, Maya will always have an incredible amount of more options than any game engine could handle."
,,,,Let's just hope that Bastion and Sombra's cup/mug design will change since their Toast victory poses are meant to be released next year so maybe they aren't final versions yet.
,,,,Reminds me of this
,,,,with his new winter skin this can be reality!
,,,,Thats adorable. Bastion doesnt need to drink so he holds up a birdbath
,,,,I just watched the entire gift waiting for bastion to pop toast out of his arm or transform into a toaster or something. But now I get it.
,,,,birb
,,,,Let me smash (smashtion returns) 
,,,,Anyone else feel like the character that can melt through an entire team in seconds shouldn't be so cute?
,,,,aww I'm disappointed.  From the title I thought he was going to turn into a toaster and make some toast.
,,,,His enemies are toast. 
,,,,OH MY GOD OH MY GOD OH MY GOD ITS SO CUTE
,,,,As is every bastion cosmetic. He's one cute fucking robot.
,,,,no i meant the bird xd
,,,,Definitely thought bastion was going to turn into a toaster. 
,,,,Frakking toasters.
,,,,"Pinky up, Bastion! Pinky up!"
,,,,Bastion itself is too cute
,,,,"I came on here thinking, no way they mage toaster bastion? Maybe the bird pops out line toast... oh... that toast. Now I want toaster bastion"
,,,,"More like ""tea pose"""
,,,,Can we talk about Mercy's? It worries me a bit.
,,,,"A toast to the groom! To the bride! From your sister, Angelica, who was always by your side."
,,,,"Ganamyde! NO!!! He ruined the tea with his feathers!Tea is literally, undrinkable!:p"
,,,,Too bad they didn't mimic the Dark Souls toast emote.  Would have have been a nice little Easter egg.
,,,,/r/PartyParrot
,,,,THE WAY IT SHOULD BE 
,,,,I was expecting he'd be a toaster. 
,,,,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
,,,,I think that's the same teacup that ana uses in the tbag emote 
,,,,"I love how they incorporate animals into the emotes and victory poses. Orisa with her dog puppy, Bastion with his bird... I wonder what's next?"
,,,,It’s drinking the waterrrr!!!!
,,,,ALL HAIL LORD GANNYMEDE
,,,,Is it bad that I judge bastion skins based on how Ganymede looks
,,,,OH NO THE BIRB BATH i need it
,,,,"Blizzard is fighting toxicity towards the game with cuteness, first Orisa's puppy emote and now this "
,,,,"Is Bastion powered by a combustion engine? Like, I get they didn't want to make him just stand there in a static position for aesthetics, but that bouncing is....unnerving. "
,,,,"most people in the western world subconsciously associate the rhythmic chugging with old tech like combustion engines, which gives bastion the feeling of being an ""old machine"", which he is - at least in-universe."
,,,,I want to see this with the Winter skin. Owl in a cup toast!
,,,,Looks great
,,,,"Damn, never realized how nice the fake ""bokeh"" looks on these preview screens.. I need to stop playing at 50% render scaling..."
,,,,I was half hoping that Bastion would reveal a built-in toaster.
,,,,"While you're all here to look at this cute bastion pose, let's all remember bastions tank form ghost shot bug and hope blizzard fixes that too."
,,,,He can’t even drink that
,,,,Clearly it’s for his little birdie buddy.

,,,,NA
,,,,NA
,,,,It's largely allowed because not allowing it is extremely hard and it's not an urgent issue for the vast majority of the users. Hard to justify the amount of work needed to stop players from having alt accounts in the top 500 for how little impact it would have.
,,,,"this. You want the team working on more skins, new maps, new heroes or some complex way of stopping someone from having 3 alts in top 500? There's no way to stop this even if you use mac/ip addresses because of the fact that LANs/gaming houses exist where multiple people share PCs. Only way to stop this is to have (pro) players voluntarily share their alts and for blizzard to then connect the accounts to one user (behind the scenes) so that only one of the accounts can be listed on the leaderboard. "
,,,,couldn't u connect competitive accounts to phone numbers? dota does this and while its not 100% effective at eliminating smurfs it has drastically reduced the number of smurfs/alts u encounter in game
,,,,"We'd have to make the compromise that these account groups couldn't be group-banned, but that accounts would have to be banned individually, or else some players won't comply with it."
,,,,Since when do the cosmetic artists design game systems and mechanics??
,,,,"You want the team working on more skins, new maps, new heroes or some complex way of stopping someone from having 3 alts in top 500? I just have to throw this in here because I see this myth repeated way too often: skins and maps are designed by entirely different personnel than those who handle more technical aspects and policies. Doing one does not usually slow the other down.Truth is that it's just not possible to neatly clean up the top 500 list as long as smurfing is allowed. And they can't do much about smurfs (IP/MAC is not reliable data for identifying them), and even if they could, they shouldn't as long as they get to the mmr where they belong quickly. At this point I'm pretty sure they make a ton of cash with people who repurchase the game several times just to play against newbies for 15 levels, and from a business perspective it probably wouldn't be wise to forbid it (again, as long as they get to their mmr quickly)."
,,,,"It’s not a myth. Have you worked in software development/IT Infrastructure projects, big engineering projects? You have a limited amount of resources be them money, people, time. Etc...even if the people working on something are different from the ones doing another thing, they all are part of the same project and in a way compete for the limit e resources allocated to the project. Blizzard might be big and OW a good money generator for them, but trust me, they have a budget to follow. People working means people getting paid, people getting paid means budget being used and the money bag being drained. So yes, 2 teams doing different things can slow down each other"
,,,,"No, I'm sorry, you're entirely missing the point:ARTISTS AREN'T PROGRAMMERS.The ones they've hired to do art? They're doing art.The ones they've hired to program? They're programming.So tasks that affect programming won't impact the workflow of the artists, and vice-versa.So yes, it is a myth that ""If they work on preventing alts from getting into the top 500 we'll get less skins/maps.""The software development/IT infrastructure side of OverWatch doesn't have 3D modellers and level-design artists writing code, anymore than you'd have an electrician also doing framing and roofing generally. They're separate disciplines."
,,,,"I think the problem is you don’t understand how projects work. Companies big or small just don’t have unlimited resources. And games more commonly than not, work on them as projects, thus the “yes it affects the” I’m sticking with. Based on your reply I’m thinking you’re stilll in college or have not worked in projects before.Hell, even where I work at right now: I’m in IT. It’s a Fortune 500 company and we badly need an important software to be either badly upgraded or entirely replaced. It’s not happening and you know why? Big biiiig efforts are going into the upgrade in the Finance org which means budget for the rest is lower which means that software and the platforms it runs on Will not get touched this year, we got budget enough to keep it up and running. See how they are connected?"
,,,,couldn't u connect competitive accounts to phone numbers? dota does this and while its not 100% effective at eliminating smurfs it has drastically reduced the number of smurfs/alts u encounter in game
,,,,"Honestly I really like this idea, but maybe only require it for top 500 because that's when people seem to care. I don't care if someone has 10 grand master accounts, doesn't bother me. But when someone has like 5 accounts in top 500 that's 4 people blocked out of their goal."
,,,,So how would you do that? lol Once you hit top 500 you have to provide your phone number or you'll be locked out of your account until you drop out of top 500??
,,,,"You just wouldn't get the top 500 award or listing till you provide a phone number and verify through text. You wouldn't be locked out of your account, but you'd basically have no top 500 recognition. Maybe set your SR to a limbo state where your SR is locked at the lowest member of top 500 until you verify. Once you verify you get the top 500 title and get your SR bumped up to what it should be."
,,,,"Nah, you just don't count for the 'top 500' leaderboard until you add the phone number.In essence you're hard-locked at ""position 501"" for the scoreboard without a phone number attached."
,,,,Smurf accounts ruin multilayer games. It's hilarious that these pros even make them. Seems a fitting way to make you look better than you actually are. 
,,,,It's not THAT hard to grab his MAC address. This would filter the list real fast.
,,,,And what if you have two different people using two different accounts on the same computer?
,,,,Do you honestly think that we have a lot of TOP 500 accounts that are sharing computers?
,,,,"I don't know, but in any case I wouldn't want to exclude 1 or 2 people from the top 500 just because they happen to be using the same computer as someone who is also in the top 500."
,,,,So instead we should exclude ~200 people because ~300 are in the top 500 more than once?
,,,,"Why is ""this is not a good solution"" always turned into a ""this or nothing"" situation?"
,,,,Reread this thread. We are examining the case where it appears that two accounts are the same person via their MAC address but in actuality they are not.
,,,,"Yeah, I understand that. The two options we have are either: keep the system how it is and allow one person to take up multiple slots in top 500, or only allow one top 500 per MAC address. I dunno I feel like the chances of two people on one computer being top 500 is a lot lower than one person in top 500 having multiple accounts there"
,,,,Consider the case where we had both in the top 500: One person with two accounts and two other people with separate accounts on the same PC. Would it be justifiable to remove the real person from the top 500 just so that we can remove the duplicate account from the guy that is there twice?
,,,,"No, it wouldn't. It's not fair. But it's also not fair for the person who would be top 500 but isn't because someone has three or four accounts in top 500. "
,,,,You're assuming those are the only options for no reason. Perhaps they're just the only options we have presented at the moment.
,,,,"You're right, I suppose we could have more of a verification process that goes along with making an account, such as having to put a phone number in or something. But there's flaws with that too. "
,,,,It's actually been proven to be only about 50 alt accounts in top 500.
,,,,"Can you prove that there aren't?If there were a single case of it, how would you justify that one of them be banished from Top 500?"
,,,,You get them to send an email to Blizzard to speak their peace. It would only be a few people tops. Also side note: I feel like this would prevent some boosting if it exists in top 500.
,,,,"Disregarding the case of multiple people sharing a computer (which doesn't seem that outlandish), spoofing any level of hardware identification is trivially easy. And, should Blizzard come up with something that's too hard/annoying to spoof, you can always throw a VM at the problem.The reality is that client-side identification isn't viable these days. We need a per-user unique ID that exists outside of the game -- much like Korea has (I hear) and what the US could have if we didn't treat our SSNs like passwords."
,,,,"You can change your MAC address if you want to. Fun trick if you're ever in an airport that gives you free WiFi ""for the first 30 minutes""."
,,,,"What if people who had multiple top 500 accounts got a star or something next to their rank saying how many accounts they had in top 500, but only count the highest one."
,,,,"I feel people should be able to de-legitimize their account to hold the Top 500 spot. Their SR will be the same and will be acknowledged as being equal to a Top 500 spot, but they won't actually be claiming a spot.This would just be a sort of ""honor system"" for people with alt accounts."
,,,,"That would fuck with the numbers, what would it say on their alt account?"
,,,,It would show the alt accounts SR with the star counting the number of top 500 accounts they have all together. My guess you would be able to toggle this feature off and on as people would immediately point to it and lay blame.
,,,,That just gives a gold star for having more money and more time. It's not like keeping several accounts requires more skill.
,,,,"Thats aimbotcalvin.All he does every single day is eat, sleep, eat, play Overwatch, and eat some more. If you want a spot in the top 10 then ''earn it retard''. And they're his words not mine."
,,,,You forgot the part where he streams and gets a shitload of money tho
,,,,If you want a shit ton of money then “earn it retard.”
,,,,Why would you eat and sleep when you could be spending that time on even more Overwatch?
,,,,Why waste money on food when you could be using it on loot boxes?
,,,,Because you can't eat dupes. Yet. 
,,,,I'd never go hungry
,,,,Those are his words? Color me genuinely surprised. I don't watch him but he always seems like a fun loving guy in all the clips I see of him. That's strange to call 99% of his fans/OW players in general retards
,,,,He doesn't say retard maliciously at all. Just seems worse when you read it over text as opposed to hearing him say it 
,,,,"Without the context, his statement seems rude. It was not said in a demeaning way at all, it's a lighthearted statement, that's all. But this is /r/Overwatch/ where things gets taken out of its proper context all day long, so... you know how that story goes..."
,,,,sounds like he earned it by putting in the time to get that good huh
,,,,How do you kill that which has no life?...
,,,,"Calvin isn't really a dick, imagine how MoonMoon says ""retard"" all the time. It's not as serious as you make it sound."
,,,,what a loser
,,,,Why would you call him that? He seems like he's having fun with his life. He also makes bank from twitch. He's probably much more successful than you in terms of money and happiness 
,,,,"That’s a leap, I think. Like, I love the game too, but if I had to play it for 12 hours a day, I’d lose my mind. I think that’s why the burnout rate for streamers is so high. A lot of them probably aren’t happy, but if you have bills that need to be paid and no other practical skills, then you’re stuck doing something you don’t like just for money. A good bit of streamers I follow publicly say they are sick of the game, but it gets them more views and donations, so the play it anyway. "
,,,,"Eugh, this is my least favorite comment I see on every game subreddit. A guy on /r/skyrim will post his game hours that equate to 8 hours played per day since release, and everyone’s just going to pretend that that’s perfectly normal and “doing what he wants.” I’m pretty sure that’s just extreme glorified escapism, but I digress.I’m not gonna hate on what this guy does in his personal life, but “much more successful than you in terms of money and happiness?” Let’s not try to guess who is happier or more successful between two unknown users, it’s asinine and petty."
,,,,"Totally agree.  It seems like for many games, there are people who do nothing in life but play them and many of them get some sort of money.  While this can be based on them being good at the game or at gaming in general, other times its because they arent good at anything else.  I recall XQC having a deep talk about how he has invested so much into playing games because he isnt good with math and he isnt good with other things that most normal people are, and that he has to put all his time into gaming because if not then he will never find work since games ARE the only thing he is good with.  Without making money from gaming, he will have nothing to put on a resume that has any real worth to it if things dont work out for him in the gaming world.Honestly, I think the idea of gaming for life is a really risky idea.  Most people who are pro gamers are very young but when they get older, the new generation of young gamers will push them to their limits and soon they will be replaced.  Now what do they do with their lifes?   I mean sure playing games sounds more fun than doing engineering work, like what I do, but my work contributes to society and my job security is very safe since finding work as an engineer is not too hard (well, its hard at first but once you get going, its not that bad)."

,,,,"Yeah I understand the actual practicality of this issue, considering I am one of the players this effects- but I don’t see why we have large discussions about this while it only affects 200ish people at max.I’ve never ended top 500 but been close the last two seasons- just means that I need to improve. Don’t blame the “system” for not giving you “your” top 500 rewards."
,,,,"It also just makes Top500 an inaccurate name. It's more like Top350 or Top300. The 500th best player in the region should (just) be on the Top500 list, but isn't. So if you finished close to Top500, you were likely cheated out of the Top500 reward because some players hog multiple spots. "
,,,,"I understand that analogy and see how that can be applied here.However, that’s not how the system is set up.The leaderboard has, and most likely will be the top 500 accounts for the foreseen future. While I am an advocate for Esports and some comparisons can be made- the practicality of application in this situation isn’t very accurate."
,,,,Overwatch is a nation of temporarily-embarrassed pros :)
,,,,GIT GoOUD yOU nOoB haHAA lets clip things streamers say and put them on reddit haHAAAA 
,,,,"Oh shit, link?"
,,,,https://clips.twitch.tv/SpeedyHardWombatHeyGirlThis is the main one going around.I actually talked to Calvin about this clip 2 days ago when we were in a game together- all this stuff gets clipped out of context and shouldn’t be taken seriously.Also at the same time I’m kinda with the mindset of “get good”. Just forces me to improve as one of the players this effects- there are no rules about multiple accounts in top 500 so I just got be one of the best to get in there and stay.
,,,,Just because it doesnt effect you doesnt mean it doesnt effect the %0.1 you are talking about. Top 500 is Top 305 currently because of the alt accounts and many people that deserve Top 500 cant get in even when they are Top 500 because of some people being too greedy.
,,,,Except this doesn't really effect us at all? I don't know a single person in gm+ that wants top 500 and complains about this. Its just one of those things where people who aren't impacted by a problem complain about it more than the people who are.
,,,,"I am one of the people that it does effect. Just means I have to earn it more, it’s how the game is set up so might as well stop bitching about how it’s the “systems” fault for not letting me get “my” top 500 rewards. "
,,,,Top 500 is Top 305 currently because of the alt accounts 195 people out of 20 million+ players doesn't really sound like a high priority issue for Blizzard to dedicate resources to.
,,,,"Because it fucking sucks for the person (not account) who should be #480 on the ladder. Top 500 is supposed to be the top 500 players, not accounts. Calvin has doubled down recently with his comments and is just trying to get as many accounts into the top 500 as he can. It’s just shitty for the people who deserve the recognition. "
,,,,People deserve recognition if they can get into top 500. If someone is good enough to get it more than once they deserve it. It really how all competitive  game ladders work. 
,,,,Let's say Calvin had 500 accounts and he got them all to top 500.What would the point be? You're not competing against 500 people for the slot. You're competing against 1 person.
,,,,that doesn't negate the amount of effort theyd have to put in to do that. compete with them if you want to get into the top 500. 
,,,,"Lol if someone is good to get into the top 500 once, they can get into it as many times as they want. That’s why it’s supposed to represent the top 500 players. "
,,,,Not to mention that most of the top 500 players actually have a surprisingly small number of games played during the season
,,,,"What meaning would Top500 have if someone was insanely good at the game and put 500 accounts in T500? Look, Nobody's said they don't deserve it. If Calvin makes it to Top 10 playing McCree then that shows how great of a McCree player he is, right? And if he did the same playing other heroes it would show he's not only good with McCree but other heroes as well. But that's not what he does. He just plays McCree on all accounts. The only reason why he does it is, to put as many accounts as he can, which is completely pointless and honestly done just to brag. It's not a surprise nor impressive that he has 5 accounts in Top 20, when all he does is play McCree, a hero which everyone knows he's good at. "
,,,,Ignoring that your example of a player having 500 accounts is mathematically impossible and a really stupid analogy. You forget that people have to play and win to get and maintain their spot. There aren't many players in high top500 who just got the rank and only play a few games to avoid decaying.Why is it a problem that someone with a lot of time invested in the game gets rewarded for spending all that time in the game?
,,,,"Imagine getting into cooking competition where you can sign in as many dishes as you want and instead of rating the cooks, the judges rate the individual dishes. And someone insanely good makes three dishes which win the first, second, and third place, while your own dish - which should be the second - is placed fourth. That's what is happening and it's just stupid and doesn't feel right. And if you can't cook replace it with singing or throwing javelin or whatever."
,,,,But that's a competition. And that also is perfectly fine to me. Its just a little icon that you get for having a certain rank in a video game. Not a cooking show.
,,,,"If it's rating the individual dishes, then you ended up right where you should be. 4th best.  If it should have been second, it would have been. Ultimately, if blizzard doesn't mind him doing it... you're just gonna have to work harder. "
,,,,"I shouldn't be replying to an analogy as if it's an actual argument but the point even in your analogy is that they're rating the dishes, not the cooks.You said it yourself that everyone can sign in as many dishes as they want. If you're in a cooking contest and you have the 4th best dish it's because yours is not better than the other 3 dishes, no matter who did them.It is exactly the same thing, I won't pretend like I deserve a spot in top500 because I've been playing for 7 seasons and luckily got to 4350sr once when there are professional players who have the time, the skill and the means to get to top500 at will and stay there after 1000 games.Its the top500 accounts, I am not in the top500 accounts, either I grind for that and inevitably push someone out of the list or derank out of the possibility. As simple as that.TLDR To reply with an equally useless analogy; if everyone except the poorest people die then I would be the wealthiest person on earth. But they're not dead, that will not happen. I will not be on the next forbes as ""richest man on earth *if all people with any money suddenly die""."
,,,,"Imagine if you cloned Usain Bolt 3 times and held a race and he got 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th. ""You got 5th place, if you want a better spot then earn it retard!""Hopefully this will put into perspective how dumb you sound."
,,,,"The best part is you don’t even need clones for that example - the 100m sprint in the olympics is basically a tournament, so the competitors race multiple times in the event. If you counted Usain Bolt’s time in both the finals and the semifinals, he’d have both the 1st and 2nd best times, and take home both gold and silver.But you don’t count them separately, because that’s not the point of the silver medal, and it makes absolutely no sense for one person to be the top two sprinters.And Usain Bolt already gets all the recognition he could want without hanging silvers and bronzes off his golds."
,,,,"Right, that's why we often have the same person getting both first and second in the Olympics. Oh wait."
,,,,"Not all, just online ones where they can't easily tie a name to a real person, so they don't even try."
,,,,"The other side of the coin is the fact Top500s complain about getting Diamonds in their games. Well no shit, you've got 2+ slots in Top500 and so does half the other people. You can't queue all your accounts at the same time so obviously it has to look for players outside of the Top500"
,,,,"Because some of the Overwatch player base are fans of the top players and streamers as an experience in and of itself. Someone above used this analogy, and I think it fits well: it's like looking up the Top 100 hockey players list and Wayne Gretzky taking up spots 1-93. When we read Top 500, we're looking for Top 500, not Top100-300 depending on how many people have played 50 games on their alts this season."
,,,,"I'm failing to see how this is such a problem. I get how it can seem unfair how one person can claim multiple spots but the fact that ""everyone"" is mad, not everyone is going to be in the top 500. "
,,,,Its funny at least to me that only the people NOT in top 500/gm are extremely angry and the other actual close to top 500 dont even care
,,,,I'm actually curious how many people here that dislike this are close to top 500. 
,,,,I'm low top 500 (#460). Kinda sucks if I get kicked out at the end of the season but I'll just try harder so that won't happen. fingers crossed
,,,,Yeah im curious as well. Seriously i have yet to see a near Top 500 complain about this
,,,,"It seems majority of those near top 500 say ""it sucks, but I'm going to get better,"" which is a mindset that probably got them to be where they are. Of course, everyone isn't a hivemind. "
,,,,"I'm 4343 SR career high, with 3 accounts over 4200SR, and I've been ~50SR from t500 with over 50 games played before, and I really want Blizzard to do something about the alts in t500.So, here's one person for you."
,,,,Well being 50 SR away wouldn't have gotten you Top500 even if it didn't have all the alts. 
,,,,"I hit my career high this season of 4.3k and I couldn't care less about it. I have been destroyed by top500 players and I know if I get there is because I earned my spot and I'm not even close to deserving it (yet).If I had the time and perseverance anyone has to get just 1 account in top500 I would probably have it, I'm closer than lots of people and know how difficult it is to do it so all I can say about whoever gets at least one account in top500 and keeps playing and keeping their spot is ""shit dude, that's nice"".I'm jealous that someone can get 4 accounts in the very top because I can't but anyone doing that without cheating... Wow, that's an achievement."
,,,,"What. Maybe because there's nothing for them to care about? They're not missing out, the people who can't get into top 500 are."
,,,,"Imagine you were good enough to be, say, rank 450. You have the skill, you put in the time and effort, yet you never achieve a top 500 spot because the people who are even better than you all have alts at the same level as their main. Yes, you are not as good as them. But do you deserve top 500? Yes. But you can never get there because the top 200 people all shove you down by creating accounts that are NOT other players surpassing you, it's just people who were already better putting alts at the same spots. Sure, it doesn't affect the vast majority of the community, but it's very unfair to the couple hundred of people who would have top 500 if no-life top ranked players weren't keeping you out by spamming accounts into those top ranks."
,,,,"""Earn it retard"" -yours truly, calvin"
,,,,"Idk how anyone could play so much to have multiple accounts in top 500. Like I burn out from playing more than 3 hours in a day and I love this game, been playing since Blizzard invited me to beta."
,,,,Damn Unkoe is like 150SR higher than Rank 2
,,,,The BIG difference is calvin plays solo in 3 different accounts while Unkoe plays with a 3-stack at 3-4am against masters and low GMs.
,,,,Jjonak was 4707 yesterday oO he dropped down that much?
,,,,I checked and he seems to be at 4724 atm. Probably on Asia leaderboard?
,,,,Jjonak was on xQc game who play on NA server and this screenshot is from NA because Unkoe is here
,,,,He hasn’t played 59 games 
,,,,Maybe not 50 games played?
,,,,He eating up that top 10. He eats everything
,,,,eats popcorn
,,,,I do wish people could register all their accounts as separate but related accounts so it would show their 3 Alts under one account listing (their highest) on the top 500. Not everyone would but it'd be better than nothing. 
,,,,I like how the top American player is actually french
,,,,"""Earn it, retard."" - aimbotcalvin, 2017."
,,,,Everyone complaining about this here is not and will not ever be near top 500. WHY DOES IT MATTER!?
,,,,Yah he’s good if he can keep 3 accounts in too 5 what’s the problem
,,,,"I mean it's aimbotcalvin how can you hate that guy? he is so nice and funny I see hate comments about him here...also he is free to do what he want if he want to eat , sleep , play OW/Fortnite he can do it don't get into his life he can do what ever he likes to do.and if he get 3accounts in top5 players he probably deserve it? but it's still stupid asf to let someone have 3accounts in the top."
,,,,"""earn it retard"""
,,,,As much as I'm not condoning it when you hear the same shit every day from salty people who blame you for not being able to get top 500 I can see why he'd snap like that. Also what is the context? All I keep seeing is this quote with zero context.
,,,,A bunch of people were telling him he should let his accounts decay since Emongg the saint of Overwatch is doing that.
,,,,"Emongg is a really nice person , but he don't have to listen to anyone and decay his own accounts because some more people need to get in the top500 if people can't get into top500 maybe they don't deserve it?"
,,,,"if people can't get into top500 maybe they don't deserve it?The whole point is that maybe they do deserve it but they're pushed back by better players taking up more than one spot. It becomes top ""less than 500"" because of it."
,,,,Grow a thicker skin.
,,,,"Damn , I didn't heard him saying it or saw a clip about it can you send me a clip that he said that?"
,,,,"I don't have a link handy, but it was a popular post a few days ago here."
,,,,"Like someone said in another topic, you enter a [whatever] contest, and you are told that you didn't win because a guy had 3 great things and earn everything. It's just not fair for those who are trying."
,,,,[deleted]
,,,,wow this isn't even close to being relevant 
,,,,"just because someone is nice doesnt mean that what they do can never be wrong. nobody cares about him only playing ow all day, its because of the top 500 thing. he earned all those t5 spots, yes, but he also took away two spots from people who also deserved it."
,,,,"What do you mean? if he took their places he deserve it not them? and people do care about what he is doing like playing OW all the day , scroll a bit up and you will see what im talking about."
,,,,"What would ya'll like to see? 500 unique players on top 500? How about two leader boards, 1 for unique players and 1 for top 500 accounts? Players can link together their accounts and have their highest SR account show up on the unique player leaderboard and then each individual one shows up where it does on the top 500 account leader board."
,,,,Nobody would link accounts...
,,,,Ok
,,,,Who cares. 
,,,,Don't hate the player hate the game unless the Overwatch team want to step in and change this it's fair game. I always thought that dual boxing multiple characters in WoW to 1 shot people was basically cheating but it's something that they allow.
,,,,Don't hate the player hate the game unless the Overwatch team want to step in and change this it's fair game. Pretty sure the point of this post is to point out the issue so Blizzard might take action.
,,,,"How would they change it? The issue is you can't always tell if an account is someone's alt or just another person playing on that same IP. Also, that doesn't excuse exploiting it. If there's a game breaking bug and people use and exploit it, does that justify it if the devs haven't fixed it yet? No, it still creates a massively unfair advantage. Just an example, though I wouldn't consider the top 500 quite on that level "
,,,,Well if you know they're the same person then count the top 7... quick maths.
,,,,"There are league pros with multiple accounts in challenger, seriously if you want it earn it."
,,,,Why has he 600 games more played than another account?
,,,,"A lot of peoppe do the 50 games to get to the top500, then stop playing once they get it and only play again to stop the decay. A lot of people do this, and streamers sometimes choose to play on their mains off-stream to avoid stream snipers."
,,,,if not for calvin I would have made it out of plat by now and be rank 29995 but instead I'm rank 30000
,,,,So who is striker?
,,,,Sick DPS player for Boston Uprising in OWL.
,,,,There’s always next season
,,,,Calvin the mad man
,,,,"Are we sure Jadeoni is Calvin? That's a ton of games for an alt account that I personally haven't seen him play on, as well as the fact that Calvin isn't much of a genji player"
,,,,If you ever watched his stream you'll know it's him
,,,,You can just watch his streams 
,,,,Does Unk0e stream? I am very curious about the top player being a support main.
,,,,You should find him by searching for Unkoe on Twitch.
,,,,Thank you! I was searching with the 0 instead of the regular 'o'.
,,,,there are actually people who hate on Calvin?  I thought only Sinatraa does that.  
,,,,"don’t forget that a lot of top500s will actually decay their alt accounts at the end of the season in order to make room for others. they’re not all selfish and egotistical, most are ya know, nice people. just saying."
,,,,Calvin is so good it's hard to keep up with what he's doing something just watching lol
,,,,"What's the point of having multiple accounts in the 500. I don't get it, what's the benefit. Surely it takes less effort to maintain the SR level of one account rather than split your attention between multiple backups."
,,,,new heroes &gt; this thing
,,,,And he plays his main on each account. im all for alts if you play different heros
,,,,"https://twitter.com/aimbotcalvin/status/942543842292613121 here you goAdditionally, he's able to maintain it on all three accounts, so if you have a problem with him ""taking your top 500 spot"", then just earn the rank "
,,,,Fk calvin
,,,,Get good. 
,,,,Is that how we get people banned in r/Overwatch?
,,,,[deleted]
,,,,"This is the worst ""serious"" argument I've ever seen on the Internet.Just think about it. "
,,,,It affects other people.
,,,,Like all the other pros with multiple accounts in top 500. 
,,,,"Just increase the number of games required to 80-100People in top 500 will do that already, it will make the ratings more accurate, it will take more time before the ratings are more saturated.But maybe nah.Definitely another top 500 where accounts are linked by IP, but then idk what would happened to the top 500 icon"
,,,,Why does he need three accounts?
,,,,"To satisfy his ego and greed, I guess."

All of a sudden I hear DINK and the winston dies saying, “WOW”.Apparently my sonic arrow landed on his bubble and fell down and headshot him after the bubble ran out."
,,,,"Loool should have taken a highlight  (press F9 to do so). You also gotta view it and save it after, if you want to."
,,,,Most accurate comment I’ve read in a while
,,,,And Symmetra vs Symmetra 
,,,,"Not really, Sym vs Sym is a who has more patience to wait inside your trap"
,,,,Sym vs Sym = who is the better baiter
,,,,Who is the master baiter*
,,,,So its me?
,,,,AND MY AXE
,,,,"Im a decent baiter, my cousin Moes, now thats a master baiter. "
,,,,or who has the shield gen up
,,,,"Sym meta should be to set up your microwaves and sit emote across each other, first to blink has to walk in the opposing sym's room"
,,,,Day 100:  both dead from lack of food.
,,,,"In terms of beam battle, whoever locks on first wins typically. And throwing your shield is a bad decision at it lets them build charge on it first before locking onto you. "
,,,,"only if they can build charge on the shield while staying out of your range - you can still target them through your shield, so they won't build up charge faster than you."
,,,,Also its worth it to use the shield after they have been hitting you for a bit already and have built some charge.
,,,,"That one was the worst in 1v1 gamemode; they removed him from the pool now.Whoever managed to leap on top of the other Winston had the lead, that was the meta I think. I don't think melee'ing had a purpose."
,,,,"Spamming melee while holding down the primary has the same dps as holding down primary without melee. This effectively made your clip last longer, and your opponent would reload before you do.It also helps get rid of the first chunk of armor health faster and the last 25 bit of health slightly faster."
,,,,Also if you melee away their last chunk of health it would be slightly faster since the damage is applied instantly. 
,,,,Tim can confirm that
,,,,Fairly sure meleeing also ignores the damage reduction from armour.
,,,,"My understanding was that armor halves the damage taken per hit, up to a max of 5. That makes it really effective against Tesla cannon, which is essentially many small hits of low damage. Armor affects melee less strongly, because it is a larger burst of damage in a single hit."
,,,,That seems reasonable.
,,,,It's the same reason Pharah and Junkrat don't really care about armor while Tracer and Soldier lose a lot of damage to it. 
,,,,Reminds me more of Paladin vs Paladin in WoW back in the day. Shit dmg + quick easy healing = infinite duels 
,,,,blood dk vs anything or everything because neither of them are going to diejustamememercyblooddoesasurprisingamountofdamage
,,,,"Then right before one of you dies, bubblehearth"
,,,,This is why I simply run from Moira unless I feel I can kill her before the sustain-fest begins.Same thing with roadhog tbh.
,,,,naw roadhog has more mind games (if you are talking hog vs hog).  you can cancel his take a breather with a hook.  It stops the damage reduction too. 
,,,,Securing an all me kill on roadhog as doomfist is one of the better feelings I get on deathmatch
,,,,Fighting a good Roadhog as Doomfist is one of the most stressful and exciting things. Winning those fights is extremely rewarding 
,,,,Same when your playing a roadhogg against a doomfist. It's a fun match up. 
,,,,"I play a lot of Roadhog as well, and hooking a doomfist mid-siesmic slam is nice"
,,,,I haven't done that yet. It sounds fun. 
,,,,"""Oh you're healing TOO BAD MEET THE WALL"""
,,,,"I love hooking Doomfist as he attempts to charge me. Like, you want over here? Ok, come to papa."
,,,,That's why you don't punch a hog that isn't doing anything other than reloading or healing
,,,,"And more importantly, his heal, or am I missing something?Nevermind, I can't read apparently."
,,,,"He probably meant roadhog vs moira, which is a surprisingly even match often coming down to which team helps their hero first."
,,,,"Lucio vs lucio, if there are no edges to boop each other off we might as well just part ways. "
,,,,"As Lucio I feel like I can't win duels vs Moira. Her kit just negates Lucio's. Her slight HPS while damaging seems better and more consistent than Lucio (as his requires aim), his boop is negated by her blink, and her ball just does too much damage. Often when I do feel like I could kill her she has ult and just wrecks me :-/"
,,,,"Yeah, in one on one Lucio can't really take her out efficiently and she mostly bypasses his main form of defense (being hard as hell to hit).She's absolutely a Lucio counter when it comes to facing off against one another.  Better to run (in DM) or get teammates instead of risk it imo."
,,,,"Can't you just out dance her? That's my go to move with Lucio, oh you think you can kill me? Well watch these MOVES!"
,,,,"Her RMB is pretty easy to aim (at least on PC) and if you are sticking with speed, you won't live long. Unless your goal is to run (which is what I suggest)"
,,,,TBH it's pretty easy on console too. Especially if you adjust the aim assist window to the size of her lock-on
,,,,"It's possible but requires some intense dancing! If you can track well with her it's really easy to just stay on target with Lucio even with him jumping around, and her Orb will chew through his health unless he can get away from it which just leaves him open for her to track him."
,,,,At least you can heal through her ult. 
,,,,"I think if it's the boosted heal you would be fine, but if she is able to track you well enough I'm not sure the base healing would be enough. The ult is weak damage wise but it's not THAT weak."
,,,,That's what I meant. You can usually amp through it. And then I get in her face so she starts trying to kill me with it instead of healing her team. Do the same thing to Orisas. Just boop em around and shoot em in the head till they die. 
,,,,"I THINK? Don't quote me on this as I'm not a math wizard, but I think as long as you're somewhat aware of Lucio shooting at you and trying to avoid some of the shots you can self heal more than he can do damage to you while ulting unless he's getting all head shots. I usually stay focused on whatever I'm focused on rather than trying to hit him because the actual hit box on the beam is atrocious and incredibly difficult to hit smaller targets with unless you're quite a way away from them."
,,,,"Oh you totally can, you really shouldn't ever lose a 1v1 against Lucio as Moira unless the Lucio double bursts you with headshots. But I count on the pettiness of players to try and kill me while I mess with them haha. It's more of ""hey, hey, over here, look at me and not your team"" type of thing. "
,,,,"I mean, Lucio in 1:1 isn't really outclassing anyone with his kit right?Yeah, the boops are sweet though. "
,,,,"Gotta catch her after the blink for the boop, then it's gg.  That's teh only viable strat, really."
,,,,I usually try to boop her off the map.
,,,,"Yup, even as tracer, just run away. No point in battleing it out with them. I always get pissed when I see the mecrees trying to duel the hog and just end up feeding him."
,,,,This is why I only play junkrat in FFA DM. Need to secure kills with some burst damage (instead of getting 1000 assists). Out of all the common picks in this mode I hate roadhog and DVa. Especially DVa. So much effort to de-mech her only for me to die and have someone steal my kill. 
,,,,"Funny enough I never see anyone beside myself play D.va in this mode. With the addition of those rockets, she's pretty much guaranteed a kill or two before losing her much."
,,,,"Yeah, Junkrat is a nice safe pick when you want to constantly secure final kills (at least at a 1 kill to 1 death rate at least).I ignore D.Va if I can and instead use her to lure weaker enemies into exposing themselves and giving me the advantage.I am also one of the players who steals the baby D.Va kills, sorry."
,,,,I straight up avoid Moira 1v1's if the enemy Moira is at full health. The sheer amount of time wasted while we slowly tickle each other  is sad. And my team is usually dead by the time I finish. 
,,,,Same with pharah 1v1's. Dancing around in the sky trying to see who can lead and weave better than the other just about guarantees one of you is going to get picked off by a hitscan before one of you kills the other
,,,,"I loooove when enemy Pharahs focus me when I'm Pharah. Occasionally they'll actually get a hit but usually only after I've killed like 5 of their teammates, thanks for not shooting mine!"
,,,,"I'm one of those Pharahs that focus on other Pharahs, mostly because I have 300 hours under Pharah (one trick pony) and I kill them under 5 seconds. Soooo satisfying."
,,,,I usually only go after the enemy Moira if I desperately need to take out the healer or I know I can make use of my Orb on her. Otherwise I'm better off attacking literally anyone else as Moira
,,,,"exactly. I'll tickle her to distract her, but will only fully engage if I know I have the upper hand and can quickly take her out."
,,,,"Yep. This is especially a thing in FFA.If your goal in FFA is just fighting, nothing wrong with Moira vs Moira, but if your goal is win or at least get top 4, you're going to want to avoid tons of ""time wasting"" fights. Like, zapping a Roadhog to death as Moira takes so long, you could've killed like 3 other people in that time."
,,,,perfectly symmetrical violence solves nothing!

,,,,"I once won a Starcraft 2 ladder match because we wound up in a true stalemate. He had lost the last of his structures that could produce air units, as well as the structures or units necessary to make new structures. Meanwhile, as Terrans, I had lost everything but a Command Center that I had floated into the void at the corner of the map, leaving it inaccessible to him. When he realized the situation that we were in:Him: ""So, what happens now?""Me: ""I dunno. I've got work, so I'll see you in 8 hours.""I came home to a victory screen."
,,,,http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/Stalemate_Detection
,,,,This is true. 
,,,,Moira in deathmatch generates unparalleled amounts of salt. I have a special hatred for her in that mode
,,,,"She is the lowest bottom feeder in deathmatch FFA. Diceroll killsteal orbs, invincible escape on 6s cooldown, barely aimed lifesteal, topped off with a ""screw everyone fighting in front of me"" ult. I hate her existence in that mode so much she gets all of my solo ults. "
,,,,"After having a game with 2 very persistent Moiras, I avoid deathmatch/ffa like the plague. It just won't go back to normal unless some adjustments are made."
,,,,"angle your healing orb towards the ground, it'll go away from you slower thus stay near you longer."
,,,,Simple geometry
,,,,This is only good if you are standing still like this. If you can move you should just follow it instead of making it fly away into the sky
,,,,"Really, you should be bouncing it off of the nearest wall that's perfectly parallel to you."
,,,,"Also useful in corridors, if you're careful you can get the or to bounce in one place. Can use it like a junkrat trap to know if someone is flanking or leave someone in the back lines a mobile health pack."
,,,,"The worst part of fighting Moira is the stupid amount of crap on your screen.  There's the beachball of doom bouncing around in your face making that noise, then the lifesteal that autoaims on you which also obscures your view, then the kamehameha beam in your face.  It's like fighting a lifesteal symmetra that can teleport to keep up with your juking, while being forced to wear a blindfold."
,,,,"Her gun is NOT auto aim. It has a generous attach range but it's definitely not auto and will instantly stop attacking if you move out of the area it can latch onto you. Where as Symmetra can stay latched on for a moment even around corners due to latency and the way the game handles attacks. The only thing in her kit that is auto aim is the orb and with the change to it, it currently will auto consume itself on shields and mei walls so you can completely waste the orb for your team if using either of those things."
,,,,"Yeah. On the Zarya-Symmetra beam spectrum, Moira's beam feel more like Zarya than Symmetra."
,,,,"If it were on a scale of 1-10, Zarya being 1 and Symmetra being 10 it's probably a 3-4 maybe? It's generous on WHEN It attaches, but it's very strict on keeping on someone. You still need to track with it to keep the damage going, just not as much as Zarya does."
,,,,Have to agree with this. Zarya is a better comparison.
,,,,I feel like this is semantics but she definitely has auto aim. The attach range you are speaking about is auto aim because it automatically aims within that range. I think that her range on that grip is entirely too long as well. 
,,,,"Agreed, her beam shouldn't be able to hit a pharah floating 15m in the air."
,,,,"You still need to track with it. Symmetra once locked onto someone can just run towards them and it will keep attached to them as long as they are in range and she is looking at them. With Moira unless the person is RIGHT on top of you, you have to track them with the beam to do a constant stream of damage, otherwise it's just chip damage since it won't stay attached. As for the range, it does 50 dps and you can get out of her aim or force her to move by shooting back at her. It's not really going to win a fight unless you can't aim well enough to hit her in return since every hero in the game can out dps her unless they have an orb on them as well."
,,,,Moira and Sym have around the same lock on forgiveness at 7m
,,,,Meh her damage is awful and if she had reduced reach it would be much harder to charge her healing. I think she is in a good place right now any slight nerf could really hurt her. 
,,,,I agree that her damage isnt terrible high but with her damage comes self heals greatly increasing her sustain while doing damage. I really think they dont need to nerf her damage or anything other than the distance of which that grip can hold. She is a healer after all. 
,,,,Don't forget that she needs to deal damage with her right-click to continue healing. Nerfing the distance would make it very difficult to gain resources to heal without sticking your neck out really dangerously.
,,,,Basically how Symmetras gun should be like. I'd actually play Symm if they changed her aiming business to be more like Moira
,,,,The loud ass audio is more annoying to me than the visual clutter
,,,,Honestly Moira v Moira and Doomfist v Doomfist are two of my favorite kinds of fights. It's like going full anime. 
,,,,going full animenot including genji v genji 
,,,,"Doomfist for sure, especially between two more experienced Doomfist players trying to psyche each other out and outmaneuver one another.So fun."

,,,,"Maybe it's just me (it probably is just me lol), but in FFA Deathmatch on console (PS4), I have a hard time as Hanzo consistently killing her. Obvs I'm just bad, but even so, the tall, thin frame makes it harder for me to hit headshots and bodyshots somehow. All this occuring while she consistently drains me of my life with her attack and damage orb."
,,,,Since her beam is more forgiving I could certainly see people on consoles having a harder time actually killing her compared to PC. On the PC it's easier to actually track people usually so it's easier for people like Hanzo or Mcree to just hit her back at the same time and kill her faster than she can self heal.
,,,,She becomes super frustrating to duel if she AD crouch spams. Her tracking doesn't suffer from it and doing it yourself against her is also useless.
,,,,"Overwatch's Hitboxes are kinda atrocious. A lot of character models have parts that just aren't part of the hitboxes for whatever reason, like Mercy wings, and a lot of abilities have incredibly misleading effects, like Genji reflect actually being 3x it's size and Earthshatter just being a giant mess of won't go around a 1/8ths inch corner but will hit that lucio on the wall behind two pillars over there.Even beyond technical issues, a lot of characters just have tiny hitboxes which are super unsatisfying to try and hit. These tiny peeps also often have incredible mobility and deal a ton of damage. They also aren't distinct enough from eachother, good luck telling if it's a Symmetra, Moira or Widowmaker in the dark or at a range. "
,,,,"They disabled Lucio in 1v1, my main, yet Orisa and Moira are in there?"
,,,,I would much rather have Lucio boop-fights than Orisa shield duels.
,,,,Orisa fights are just waiting for one of the two to get bored enough to do something stupid.
,,,,Yup
,,,,"Actually, you can go full aggro and throw your shield ""inside"" her shield, because of the format you'll have protection while she doesn't, she'll either have to back off or go all in too."
,,,,Not all maps have boop possibilities though
,,,,D.Va is also one of those heroes where I'm not sure why she's disabled.
,,,,"They disabled her in 1v1? She used to be available, why would they take her out? Because it took a long time is about the only thing I can think of but even then it wasn't nearly as long as Orisa can be."
,,,,whoever gets knocked out of mech first loses
,,,,Granted two really good Lucio's have 0% change to kill each other. I found another Lucio main with 200+ hrs like me and we went 1v1 in an FFA in a room by ourselves and it went on for about 2 minutes until both of us agreed it was a waste of time.

,,,,"Ha, I knew what it was going to be exclusively from ""Little Hangleton"" in the link. I read those books too much as a child."
,,,,No Tracer coming in for the last hit or Junkrat concussion mine to kill you both? FAKE.
,,,,How it feels to chew 5 gum
,,,,"I love 1v1 Moira. Usually comes down to who plays the best mind games. Gold orb almost always, try to pull them away from there's. Dark orb if under half hp and their orb has over 50% cd."
,,,,If she has already used her dash you can safely force her out of a fight with your damage orb or even kill her. Whoever can get a dash off to avoid the orb is going to win the fight or at least run her off rather than stand there sustaining each other for ages with the yellow orbs =p
,,,,"I love them too. I win almost every 1v1 fight as Moira. For Moira vs. Moira, I start out with the gold orb, throw my damage and stick my secondary attack to them, fade from their damage, and have my secondary attack stick as soon as I am done fading. If they heal out of my damage, I pull back and repeat. Sometimes, I try to bait out their orbs and lure them to another room or area where mine could have maximum effect. I also tend to find the ult not very useful without teammates."
,,,,That feel when you've never played the hero before so you just send the healing orb off towards the enemy for some reason. 
,,,,"In this case, the healing orb was sent toward the enemy so that it could spend a small amount of time healing Moira herself (it's 75 HPS vs the damage orb's 50 DPS, it's better to use it) without forcing her to turn away and stop damaging the other Moira"
,,,,"Maybe I'm backseating, but I feel like a flick to the left to bounce it off the wall back to herself and doubling the healing gained would have been a lot better. "
,,,,"Yeah, I said that elsewhere in the thread too. It would have been a better play."
,,,,"Stay at range and use strafing. Turns it back into an aim contest, still takes longer than it should, but it has more moments where one person is getting damage in and the other isn't. Other than that, use orbs as mentioned by others here."
,,,,https://youtu.be/vpFIj_8daVU?t=3m24s The likeness is striking
,,,,i had something similar happen but then a genji thought he could dragonblade us but we paused our battle and focused him instead. lolz were had
,,,,"If I see too many Moira's in DM I switch to Roadhog, try to hook her, if not successful I wait for the CD while using the heal to sustain myself until then.I have a good success rate with until a **** Mcree, Hanzo, Reapet, Junkrat come in thinking ""easy double kill"" and ends up giving the Moira the winning kills of the game. "
,,,,OMG it's Vanilla WoW paladin duels all over again...
,,,,Looks like the final fight between Harry Potter and Voldemort

,,,,"Typical QP Rein play, shielding too late, and only himself :D It did happen when he just about charged someone, still had time to save a couple people though, if he reacted faster. "
,,,,"That's a maybe. Charging D.Va into the Hanzo Ult was solid move. McCree was completely out of his POV after the charge though, so knowing where the dead eye was coming from would have required Jedi level reflexes. It's difficult to know if you should move and shield or immediately shield when you don't know the direction of the threat. Also, that hammer blow was probably already triggered when the dead eye started."
,,,,What? From the direction he is facing and the very blatant dead eye voice queue it’s impossible not to tell where the dead eye is coming in that situation immediately.  All he needed to do is the trick where you jump then shield to keep your momentum to move faster while shielding to cover the guys behind him instead of shielding the wall.

Genji is a three star McCree is a two star meaning McCree is a little easier to play then Genji, not to mention Genji doesn't use an aimbot for his ult either."
,,,,"I agree with you completely, read my comment again. I am expressing sarcasm as to what this sub finds impressive. "

,,,,Amazing play!! 
,,,,Very nice I agree 
,,,,Your team was right! Nice one
,,,,And what do you think op?
,,,,"I think it is now, there was another Mcree play yesterday better than mine though is why I was uncertain."
,,,,That rein kill was fucking spicy. 
,,,,Happy cake day
,,,,everything until the rein kill wasn't even POGCHAMP worthy 
,,,,"I think this just outlines how sloppy quickplay is, lol"
,,,,Yeah that right click on the hog is 100% reddit worthy
,,,,I guess ur team was wrong. LUL
,,,,No they didn’t 
,,,,This is almost as impressive as genji killing people in graviton. Sick skill.
,,,,So not impressive
,,,,"quickplay, yawn. "
,,,,"FOR I AM THE GREAT GATEKEEPER, FOR THIS PLAY OF THE GAME DID NOT HAPPEN AT 2769 SR IN COMPETITIVE WHILE ITS RAINING ON JUPITER AND THE PLANETS ARE ALIGNED AND THERE IS AN ECLIPSE HAPPENING AND A FAMOUS ACTOR DIED OF A COCAINE OVERDOSE AND AT THAT EXACT MOMENT THE SAME ACTOR GETS ACCUSED OF RAPE AND THERE ARE HALLMARK MOVIES ON TELEVISION AND THE SONG ""LET IT SNOW"" IS PLAYING ON THE LOCAL RADIO AND YOU ARE GETTING BLOWN AND IT ALL HAD TO HAPPEN AT 11:36:44 PM ON A WEDNESDAY FOR THIS PARTICULAR PLAY OF THE GAME TO COUNT!

,,,,So how many games did that guy leave because he couldn't pick Pharrah is the real issue here 
,,,,I don't normally see people insta lock pharah
,,,,I promise you there’s no way in hell this guy went through over a thousand hours of Pharah without leaving a lot of games.  I’m a Pharah main and it happens more than you think.
,,,,"it probably happens exactly as often as he thinks since he would see someone instalock pharahthe only times ive seen it is if some duo thinks theyre really smart and instalock pharah mercy, then fly around together all game doing their own thing"
,,,,"So you’re saying that this random person on the internet noticed every little detail of every little game and has NEVER seen someone instalock Pharah?  Absolutely no way, sorry man.  "
,,,,Do you really think it never happened in more than 1000 hours that someone picked Pharah before this guy ? 
,,,,Wonder if he plays competitive
,,,,"Only an issue if he played competitive, otherwise it's not a problem at all."
,,,,Is it even possible to have 28k damage in a quick play game tho ?
,,,,That's the problem
,,,,there is a guy with like 2000 torbjörn hours i think
,,,,I think the special thing about this is that he has only played Pharah.
,,,,"Clearly you've never seen EeveeA, he has a second account which is also pure Mercy called EeveeB and a third which is almost pure Mercy called EeveeC. Retired now I think."
,,,,retired? She is still streaming? and she also has a 4th account now where she plays other heroes
,,,,I think he is a guy he had face cam.
,,,,"She is trans, said it on twitter but doesnt mind ""he""  as well"
,,,,She is trans? oh didn't knew that.
,,,,"Saying you ""don't mind he"" is just a way of avoiding as many awkward troll conversations as possible. Lotsa horrible people on the interwebs. Especially being a streamer I can imagine this is the only way to avoid banning people who purposely try and troll her with pronouns which would likely lead to a lot more unneeded harassment."
,,,,"i think its great now we can all pick our pronouns, people need to get with the timesif you want to reply to me my pronouns are 'dragonborn/dragonbooo'"
,,,,"I'll just stick with 'asshole', thanks."
,,,,Ew
,,,,I don't think eevea ever used face cam? Any link?
,,,,https://www.twitch.tv/videos/211387756 here he/she did face cam.
,,,,Thanks
,,,,She??  I saw eeva stream once or twice he sound like a guy I think??
,,,,Eeveea is trans.
,,,,....EeveeA is a guy......edit: unless this is someone else who took the name EeveeD or something like that
,,,,"She is trans, she said it on twitter but doesnt mind ""he""  as well"
,,,,So used to be a guy now is a woman?
,,,,"Born a male, felt themselves to be more natural as a women."
,,,,He played so much mercy he became mercy

,,,,"Retired now I think.Ya, because he/she (or whatever) just whined and cried about Mercy changes instead of learning to play with the new toolkit.  Good riddance."
,,,,"She's not retired, i just think she isn't a mercy one-trick anymore"
,,,,How does he buy a game and never try any other hero
,,,,Might not be their only account. Might have decided the game was fun enough on that hero.

,,,,You know you can screenshot stuff on Xbox right? Just press home then y.
,,,,Yep I know

,,,,Mystery heroes is a mess though 
,,,,But it's a fun mess!

,,,,But I can practice heroes without the pressure of scrutiny from 5 equally terrible dps. 
,,,,"As a Sym player, I am insulted. Also, even if you lose, it can still be fun"
,,,,"even if you lose, it can still be funinconceivable "
,,,,I present to you1880 hours Mercy.And that was a week ago. Easily 1900 by now.
,,,,I met a Mercy OTP in QP who had also 1600 hours on Mercy. She was barley diamond and s***talked my team and ranked shamed them for being plats. Second most played hero was Symmetra with 2hours. How TF is this even possible...
,,,,"Ah Karai. I run into that person pretty often, always funny to see how many more hours they have from the previous time. Had 6 more hours than yours so must've been either the same or next day lol"
,,,,Karai is in my game right now actually.1901 hours now
,,,,Why are you talking on reddit during a game?! Only half joking I'm gonna assume it's between rounds...
,,,,I'm done with comp for the season. Leaving it at 4421 and hoping that's enough for Top 500 by the end.It's QP.
,,,,Jesus bloody christ 
,,,,Is that 130 million healing? Wow
,,,,What's their rank? With that many hours they have to have one tricked to GM at least
,,,,"Grandmaster, yeah. Just barely though."
,,,,imagine spending 78 straight days of gametime watching 5 other people play overwatch.... 
,,,,"(edit): This player has more hours on Sym than I have totalThat is to say, congratulations! :DNo more congrats, lol"
,,,,That's not me. I have less than an hour on Sym.955ish on D.Va though.
,,,,"That's my dream, right there."
,,,,I find Pharah to be one of if not the most boring hero in the game. So how anyone could play her and only her for that long baffles me.
,,,,:( I love playing Pharah
,,,,"To each their own, play what you enjoy I just really don't enjoy Pharah's playstyle. I love high mobility heroes but Pharah's flight is so slow and boring imo. It's a constant game of peek a boo with a rocket launcher, and other people can enjoy it but I'll never get the appeal."
,,,,"Pharah is only camping a corner during the lead up to a fight. During the fight you're generally in a much closer range, being a quasi-dive on the enemy backline and disrupting positioning with direct hits and concussion blast. You can't just take one piece of a characters role during a fight and calling it their whole playstyle. By the same logic you could say that McCree's entire playstyle is sitting on top of friendly supports to flash-kill enemy flankers. This game is too vast and most characters have too high a skill cap to say they each only have one ""correct"" playstyle"
,,,,"As pharah, you want to be corner/ledge peaking whenever possible, especially during the fight. One of the most common mistakes I see pharah players making is flying out in the open to do something, when they could be doing the exact same thing while being perched on high ground or around a corner.Going balls deep certainly has its place, but should be used as a backup plan for situations where you can't corner/ledge peak effectively. "
,,,,"That's what I love about OW. There are so many playstyles that make it almost like a new game from character to character. I like a ton of them, but hate others. I have disabilities so I just flat-out can't play Genji, I feel like a 5 year old with bad motor skills trying to play Genji"
,,,,I can compeletely agree with that. I rarely get bored of Overwatch cause each hero feels like you're playing a different game.
,,,,Maybe you're the pharah who jus tries to shoot rockets from spawn to not die. There's a lot more tactics and playstyles involved 
,,,,"No, I'm not a bad Pharah. But the majority of her playstyle is peeking shots from cover in the air, to get picks. At least when they have a hitscan, otherwise you're a bit more free in what you can do. Still it's mainly her movement that puts me off. It's just nor enjoyable compared to other high mobility heroes even though it's very advantageous."
,,,,I mean it differs from people to people. Some like playing mercy when others think it's a dead character holding right click right? For me I like flexing anything if I have a good team I like all characters play style tho. 
,,,,First of all how dare you. 
,,,,I know an Office reference when I see one!
,,,,lol
,,,,The most OP character in game. She can get some extreme vantage points and shoot down. Good luck aiming up while in front of a choke and staying alive. She can tilt the enemy team faster than any other hero with only a few healer picks... who will later scream at their hitscan that they're not doing their job. And those rockets.... you can actually hear them the nano second before impact... a few of those are enough to give you ptsd if you're up against a Pharah that solo dives you and wins.
,,,,Pharah is pretty fragile without a Mercy. And even with one a good hitscan can wipe her with discord. And a good Widowmaker can shutdown a Pharah completely.
,,,,She's useful for breaking strats and getting good vantage points and one of the easiest characters to play well so she has appeal.
,,,,Your opinion but the most boring hero in the game is 100% mercy idc fight me. 
,,,,Thats called a dedicated smurf/ one trick
,,,,I like Mercy's movement and the satisfaction she brings from keeping your team alive.
,,,,"I had a game with a person having similar hours on McCree, he even had a golden border. Amazing!"
,,,,Damn. I got up to almost 400 hours of Lucio before Mercywatch and thought I was pretty hardcore.
,,,,"I had someone with over 1k hours on Symmetra in my comp game the other day. They also had hours on Torb and Bastion, though, I believe."
,,,,"There's a guy on EU with 1100 hours on mercy, no time on any other heros monkaSI see him quite a lot."
,,,,"As more players come out with their hilarious amount of hours on certain heroes comparatively, I think what's most striking about this particular player is it seems to be Pharah or bust. As in, this person either plays Pharah or doesn't play the game at all. It is mindboggling to me, to say the least."
,,,,I've learned to stop doubting the power of dedication when I've been in a game with this amount of playtime.
,,,,[deleted]
,,,,"I know, fuck them for enjoying playing a character."
,,,,"Some people only play war FPS's, or only play racing games, or only play sports games. That's ok, it's just their thing. OW is cool because maybe there are people who are usually war FPS loyalists, but maybe they got into OW because of the lore and now wreck people as 76. Maybe there are fighting game people who thought ""whoa, Doomfist looks cool, maybe I'll try this game out."" I'd never really played a game like OW before, and now, I realize the Engineer class is really awesome and I've never played a game with Torb's playstyle. Every hero starts somewhere I guess."

,,,,"Reinhardt with lag made me feel like I was playing Dark Souls. I have a shield and weapon, I don’t know what’s happening, and then I die."
,,,,"haha, you need to roll!"
,,,,I am more curious how you got the 5 kills if you had the lag the whole game.

,,,,And at least new enough for doomfist to be in it
,,,,So according to my calculations...
,,,,Between July 27 and September 19
,,,,Is that really when old res died? Jeez time flies

,,,,oh yOU DIDN'T
,,,,Seeing the death icon made me realize I kind of miss using Mercy's old ultimate. Flying in and watch the number go from 1-2-3-4 HUGE REZ!
,,,,I miss getting that feeling as a support. The same as getting 3+ kills with a dps. 
,,,,Learn your sleepdarts and get that long lost feeling again!
,,,,"Without any of the skill required, of course. "
,,,,And....why should I care about how much skill it takes-nvmi guess pressing Q with soldier takes more skill than pressing Q with mercy
,,,,"Yes, tac visor and death blossom are really skill-intensive ways to get 3k's, amirite?"

,,,,You probably could have killed her if you had been willing to use the res invulnerability. 
,,,,I 1000% would solo ult to take her down with my newly raised buddy. Fuck mei
,,,,"Yeah if Mercy had pulled her gun out and hit the mei a few times, rezzed, then kept shooting she probably could have killed Mei by herself. "

,,,,"It's not about wasting an ult, it's about sending a message. "
,,,,"I get what you're saying, but on the flip side if I've bullied someone enough that they solo ult me, I just find it a hilarious waste. Case in point, last night enemy Zarya has ult (KotH), enemy Pharah solo ults me off to the side as Bastion (I kept killing her in recon mode). Enemy Zarya in match chat (paraphrased): OMG PHURRAH WTF I WAS SETTING UP FOR U!!!!  Classic!"
,,,,Solo ult =/= Wasted ult. 
,,,,But u died right
,,,,"This is why I stopped playing Zarya. She's fun to play and her ult combos amazingly well with alot of other ults......but heaven forbid trigger happy dps players trying to be the heroes waits for Zarya ult. No, they have to go and blow their ult and maybe get like 2 meaningless kills even after I let them know the % of my ult and to get ready to combo. They just cant resist pressing Q when that UI lights up."
,,,,"It's all situational, I'm high Masters and ult combos are way too predictable on either team. As a Zarya with an ult, you can bait vital ults to open the window for another teams ult. Ex. Know their Zenyatta has an ult? Use your ult to use up their ult when he's not in full position to take him out of the fight, opening the door to a soldier ult, Genji ult, etc. Same goes for solo ulting a Mercy. Solo ulting can open the window for your team ults to go uncountered and uncontested. "
,,,,"Was that message ""I just wasted an ult?"""
,,,,3 enemies use their ults to wipe our team. Wow they just wasted their ults. I hear this all the time. Same with...wow he solo ulted me3 people in kill feed killed with that ult. 
,,,,"I have had people solo ult me when i play Symmetra, people hate her"
,,,,"If it's mystery heros, I would solo ult sym given the chance. Torb too!"

,,,,"When I'm playing Moira I look at Roadhog as a walking health battery. I don't try to take him down, I just bait the hook out and lifesteal to heal my team with. His health pool is almost bottomless and he's easy enough to avoid if you're careful."
,,,,"Eh. Hog is kind of dangerous for Moria to farm. You can farm pretty much any other tank 1v1 as long as you are ready to flee, but with hog, he can right click and delete your face at any time. "
,,,,"You can't be right next to him, that's just asking to get burned down. But her lifesteal range is high enough that she can avoid a lot of his damage. The real trick is to watch for the hook.I don't like trying to farm Rein or Orisa because the barrier makes that a waste of time, and Zarya's bubbles are an issue. D.Va's pretty mobile, but she's pretty easy to farm also. "
,,,,"A lot of moira's jump the gun on the fade and then are either forced to run or die. Same thing with tracers or gengus, If you stare at them for long enough and melee they'll get scared and mess up, then you hook em and cook em."
,,,,"One thing I've found that really throws some people for a loop is to suddenly fade right behind them or straight into their grill and mix up the lifesteal with a couple of melee attacks.The melee does 30 instant damage; if you can drop a health orb to keep yourself going while you do it, you can get in closer than their comfortable engagement range and kill them faster than they expect you to be able to."
,,,,Reminds me of the time Reinhardt and Ana tried to team up to punk me.
,,,,He just wanted to show you his flexing abilities :C

,,,,This post's title v2.0
,,,,Oh geez what an evil grin Moira has when she attacks.
,,,,That's the face of determination
,,,,"I don’t get these Moiras who are right up in your face especially the ones who do this to tanks, honestly it makes me cringe a bit and her range is fairly decent but fair play to you OP Winston!"
,,,,"shes a hero that can greatly benefit from scratching meleeing during alt-fire, but i wouldnt trust a winston by a cliff."
,,,,"I agree with that she can dispatch squishy heroes like that pretty quickly but being in the face of a Rein, Roadhog or a Winston is just asking for it."
,,,,I love how she tried to fade back onto the map before realizing that you can't gain vertical distance with it
,,,,Unless they changed it you can gain vertical distance you need to hit certain types of surfaces.
,,,,"Why do moira’s play like this! She’s a bloody healer, stick with your team and heal! You arent dps! I frequently out heal our teams mercy with her!"
,,,,That’s the problem with her. She is a pretty good non tank dps with her succ orb and right click combo. 
,,,,"Something tells me that the type of Moira player displayed in this clip doesn't care much for strategy or winning. I can't imagine what she thought she was going to do, even if Winston didn't knock her off she wouldn't have killed him and wouldn't have survived and wouldn't have healed her team, she literally just put herself into a position where she couldn't do anything at all."
,,,,"I mean, Winston has no burst or stun. Once she gets low, she can just disengage with Fade. Besides she was on full health, and the Winston was on half health. With the orb I think killing Winston is reasonable. Your time is probably better spent healing your team, but let's not pretend trying to fight a half-dead Winston is somehow completely insane as Moira."
,,,,"She was probably thinking, ""this Winston is fleeing alone and can't kill me, I'll farming him for ult charge or flat out kill him if he is dumb"", not realizing that he might blow an ult on her. "
,,,,OW community: Why are none of the healers fun to play? Give them some DPS so they can be enjoyable!Also OW community: Why is the new healer playing like a DPS? She should focus on healing!
,,,,Almost like the sub is made up of different people with different opinions.
,,,,You'd never know that sometimes lol.
,,,,We are all.. one.
,,,,The Iris consumes you.
,,,,Is this the Swarm? I want it to be like the Zerg Swarm
,,,,"She believes, let her be!"
,,,,"I mean she does require dealing damage with her secondary to heal. I tend to use the orb to heal more often than not in an engagement and use the primary healing as burst healing when one of my team-mates is getting concentrated on, and to top off health after-combat if we don't have a lucio."
,,,,I've been pretty consistently getting gold elims and healing in the same match 
,,,,"Yeah I’m a Zen main but once I went 46-6 with 16k healing with Moira in comp, I started to change my main. I didn’t realize how fun healing was when you use a powerful healer "
,,,,"I find her to be most effective when played ultra agressive and harrasing enemy supports/squishies. If you stand back and heal only, you are kinda useless because you have limited healing ability. You also become super squishy. You can overcome those problems by being super agressive, since it recharges your hp and heal energy. Looking at all those things, im sure blizzard meant for her to be played like this, not staying back."
,,,,What did the five fingers say to the face?SLAP!!
,,,,Darkness. Darkness everybody!
,,,,Winston is passively aggressive
,,,,Hi there.
,,,,I have this habit of greeting almost at every chance given
,,,,Could she have faded to avoid the fall?
,,,,If she was smart she would have faded when Winston ulted to avoid the smacc. It's not like she couldnt have seen what was coming.
,,,,"If she could have reacted before she actually went off the cliff, then yes she could have saved herself from the fall.  She shouldn't have been nearly that close to begin with tho.  The range on her beam is pretty long."
,,,,"If it was me, I would have faded immediately after his ult, retreated backwards, and fell down the cliff."
,,,,Moira is good against most heroes except most tanks.I can’t get to kill a Roadhog on my own as her.
,,,,Solo-killing Roadhog is difficult with almost any hero xD
,,,,"I usually advice people in deathmatch to join up to get rid of Roadhog, but still, they rather kill themselves and feed the obese man.That Roadhog won the deathmatch 20-2"
,,,,I love how she tries to save herself teleporting haha
,,,,"'Hi there' being the last words she hears as her concussed, mangled, body falls into the abyss "
,,,,the monke is always polite

,,,,Lol that looked like a brawler to you?
,,,,Woosh
,,,,"I've seen many people call him a simple, dumbed down character with a straight face. I guess you're saying you were just joking? Sorry, sarcasm is hard on the internet."
,,,,everyone is hard on the internet
,,,,"One of the better montages tbh, good shit OP. Bonus points for the j00m ending LUL"
,,,,I usually hate these posts but good fuckin' lord. I could watch you play DF all day. Good stuff. 
,,,,"That Rein kill at 2:35, he doesn't even finish watching to make sure he goes over. If OW was an action movie, he just straight up walked away from an explosion he caused without looking back. God damn."
,,,,"Cool guys, don’t look at explosions"
,,,,That comma.
,,,,it's bothering me too
,,,,They needed the comma so you would pause while they put on their shades.
,,,,"Thx for the advice, from now on I will refrain from directly looking at explosions."
,,,,"Yeah, them just knowing people were gonna die was probably the most impressive part of this. Even with their shotgun-knuckle kills they were really fast to turn away and acquire a new target."
,,,,I usually hate these posts Why? 
,,,,They’re usually either click bait or trash. 
,,,,Cause they're <U+653C><U+3E64><U+613C><U+3E30><U+623C><U+3E64><U+653C><U+3E64><U+623C><U+3E32><U+613C><U+3E39>
,,,,Why?
,,,,"There infinitely better than seeing yet another shitty 4k dragonblade POTG... ""I'm really proud of this one!!"""
,,,,holy shit those jumps
,,,,Sniping people from across the map with DF looks amazing
,,,,They're cool but they're definitely exploiting.If it didn't take so much time and skill to learn and perfect them then they would have been patched by now
,,,,"I wouldn't really consider it an exploit to get to some high spot then launch yourself over a roof to ambush people :s you can do the same with anybody that has vertical mobility: winston, junkrat, dva (dva ult), etc.The only thing that could mildly be called an exploit IMO is using that little spot on the 1st point of dorado where he punches the round thing on the floor and it launches him straight upward. But I think that's more of a quirk with the geometry of that floor than anything. All of the rooftop stuff seems pretty kosher to me."
,,,,"The roof one where they're camping the forward spawn on Hollywood and when he's at the skybox on Volskya last definitely are. Gliding and stuff is all good but you're explicitly not supposed to be able to just chill out on roofs, that's why they're super slippery. It's not as egregious as reapring through walls or anything but it's still abusing an exploit. "
,,,,He is using his ability in an unintended way to gain extra distance and charge up the damage to max when using the slam...Definition of exploiting
,,,,"Damn, you should make a guide for some of these shortcuts/flank routes.  "
,,,,I thought # 1 doomfist was chipsa
,,,,"chipsa is a nutty beast and I love his stream, and we interchange from rank 1 and rank 2 a lot"
,,,,How do you measure who's rank 1 and 2? Just who has higher SR and then since you're both doomfist mains it's the higher sr?
,,,,"overbuff, although it's not insanely accurate is what people use mostly"
,,,,"hey you should do a rollout guide, id love to learn more about doomfist"
,,,,I find it often best to not get there first and be soloed out
,,,,"Thank the Lord I have another top doomfist player to watch. Watching Chipsa is a chore, so toxic and whiney."
,,,,overbuff also puts someone like flower lower than kephrii
,,,,"sr and stat wise kephrii is better. flower doesn't play ranked enough for him to get up there. he's definitely better in the grand scheme of things but in ladder rating kephrii is ""better""."
,,,,in terms of skill flower is better but because kephrii plays more ranked he has a higher sr
,,,,I’m actually the number one Doomfist.See? Anyone can claim that.
,,,,"that's dumb dude, check overbuff yourself. Statistics says it all."
,,,,i like ur edge slides more than chips. his Boost punch into mid air uppercut combos on mercies and pharahs are just insane  tho. really good air control. appreciate learning from both.
,,,,Chips and is EU. By the look if it this is NA.
,,,,I thought that too...
,,,,That's some crazy good Doomfist play right there. I think I learned some interesting strategies to try just by watching this.
,,,,As a Doomfist main im always impressed on the map base mobility combos that you can use to kill enemies (such as using the well on Dorado). Can you make a tutorial base on the best spots for doomfist to practice their mobility and combination? 
,,,,+1 bigtime. Knowing the surf combo spots to let you get vertical without using uppercut is crucial.
,,,,Do you have a twitch? <U+653C><U+3E64><U+613C><U+3E30><U+623C><U+3E64><U+653C><U+3E64><U+623C><U+3E31><U+383C><U+3E30>

,,,,Ty! I’ll make sure to follow :) Really enjoyed this montage especially the last part! 
,,,,my god... just watching this one montage is making me recast my conception of how good doomfist can be
,,,,"As someone who recently went through this same thing, I can vouch that once you get a feel for THAT kind of movement it becomes an entirely different ballgame. He's my new genji, mostly because I just cant get gud with genji"
,,,,Hi5!  Me too!Genji and I just aren't friends so I'm glad DF provides a dodgy/flanky role that works with my play style.
,,,,"I've got 289 hours on Lucio and Doomfist is as fun as, if not more than, Lucio. The meta doesnt much like Lucio right now, so I play Doomfist when I dont want to play moira, zen, or mercy."
,,,,"I highly recommend this guys stream. I randomly came across it last week, had only about 4 viewers but just such satisfying game play and a really chilled out guy."
,,,,Not saying you're better than Chipsa but this montage was definitely more enjoyable. No sick airborne Pharah kills though.
,,,,Airborn Pharah kills make me sad. :(
,,,,"What I learned on Reddit today is......How to make Reinhardts uninstall with Doomfist. Seriously though, that's so dirty just tossing him off the cliff every time he spawns"
,,,,Picking DF and seeing a Rein on the enemy team is always a treat.  
,,,,"Im a mid diamond doomfist that sunk 50 hours in df this season.Its insane how much more you use terrain and height to murder people.That maxed out slam from a roof seems so good, thats one im going to have to work on.Amazing plays, im definitely going to take notes on this lol."
,,,,Can I borrow your enemies? Mine shoot back.
,,,,come on don't take away from his skill. I'm sure your joking but top 500 players definitely shoot back. 
,,,,"Just joking. I understand that for every nice combo in the video, he probably failed a couple of times. "
,,,,Most of his plays were made by using jump spots and hiding in weird places. Easier to shoot a doomfist you see coming at you over one that flew in from across the map and into your face.
,,,,"Precisely! I was a doomfist hater til I saw this now I wanna try to do decent with him. I noticed they were focusing him a lot but he just is like some super quick Genji player, all over the place! Good stuff"
,,,,"He's like genji with a train on his arm. Easily the most fun hero to play imo. When you are doing good on doomfist, you just feel unstoppable.  "
,,,,"Not to mention there are times in this montage where this dude gets up to nearly a 400 HP pool, freakin' TANK"
,,,,"I fly in from across the map and still get fucked mid air by a rogue scatter shot, or a well placed arrow."
,,,,more like hes a top 500 player because he can consistently hit montage-worthy plays
,,,,"That solider on volksya tho, gets slammed in the face and just stands there shootin' orisa all day. "
,,,,"After a certain sr people just stop caring unfortunately, he probably doesn't even have sound on or music playing."
,,,,"""top 500 enemies suck lol""your enemies shoot back because you arent as creative or as accurate as this doomfist. i guarantee if you were fighting this guy youd be dead before you even saw him coming "
,,,,"The whole point of Doomfist is to catch people by surprise and instagib them so that they literally have no chance to shoot back before they're dead. Which is why I don't honestly really like him as a hero and am sorta-kinda glad he's out of meta; fighting against a nutty Doomfist is frustrating as all hell.It takes sick skill to pull off though, so I definitely respect the DF players, even if I don't like the hero."
,,,,I did notice that the McCree's in the video specifically seemed to just tunnel vision into whatever they were focused on and get their shit handed to them
,,,,"What are your thoughts about Sombra? In theory she should make Doomfist useless with her hack, but do you worry when she is in the enemy team?"
,,,,"Sombra's hack is interrupted by taking any damage, so as long as your team is aware of her and the flank I would think it manageable"
,,,,"Yes, her hack interruption is one of the many things that make her weak and borderline useless. She should be the ultimate counter in the game, but anything can stop the hack. And even when she hacks someone she has a hard time killing the person. I like to play Sombra a lot, but I always find hard to hack and kill Doomfist, either because he can run away before the hack is done or because I'm getting punched in the face while doing it. "
,,,,Holy shit

,,,,"There's quite a lot to him, my main point would be is to try and learn when to go in and when to peel. I'll be making an extensive guide once I get back from my vacation in a week."
,,,,Cool! Will be sure to check it out. Hopefully some of my knowledge from tracer will carry over. 
,,,,"Will suck you off for that.  I've been really getting into DF lately and I'd love a lot of general tips for a masters player trying to climb as him. Generally, I understand the combo and how to execute people with him. But your aim and in-the-fray awareness/orientation is amazing, rivaling the best Genjis for certain. It's very difficult to track where people are when I uppercut two of them under a bridge and get bounced around and shit, and his CD's are so fast I often forget that his punch just came back up. You use it to engage but it's back up mid-fight too.  And unfortunately, he has such a positive feedback loop. If you dive 3 like that and don't kill 2 in the uppercut, you need to retreat with the punch instead of looking for a third person."

,,,,"That is really cool, Doomfist is a very interesting character to watch someone who knows what they are doing play. I am a terrible fist and need to practice more but seeing this definitely motivates me. "

,,,,"I've played with you before, accidentally took DF on Hanamura from you and you freaked, picked Sym, and left voice. Just heard people talking about a DF main but I didn't know who they were talking about until you left voice. No ill will was meant, sorry friend. "
,,,,"Saw you play on Wraxu's stream last night where you kept owning the Soldier and he was going crazy, great stuff!"
,,,,Holy fucking shit im speechless 
,,,,"Oh man I love Doomfist play so much, he's just so versatile.  One of the only characters that can go from protecting your back line to demolishing a tricky enemy position ahead of the team in a single action.  &lt;3"
,,,,I wish I could play Doom as good as you. I always die halfway through rocket punch and my body ragdolls to the moon. 
,,,,I didn't even know you could use rocket punch to move around and bounce off things.
,,,,"Man, your game IQ is through to roof!"
,,,,I'm only the #198 doom atm. I'm hoping to be able to stand near you at some point.
,,,,"This was very entertaining sir. It makes me want to get good at doomfist, but he's fucking difficult to play imo.  When I play comp and I see someone playing doomfist he is the first target I'm killing because he's so dangerous. It seems like some players aren't aware that they should be focusing him down. "
,,,,"With the state he’s at, people don’t see him as a threat (because of all of his bugs) but he is a powerful dps, and if you’re matched against a good doomfist, you had better cover your ass and run once they’re on the warpath"
,,,,imo a (good) doomfist is the BIGGEST dps thread when initially starting out a battle. I mean he can flank and one shot healers. I always target that motherfucker first. Agreed with your points though. 
,,,,Those poor zeyattas
,,,,"I consider myself a pretty good doomfist, but holy shit. This is awesome."
,,,,OP have you gone up against ChipsA before? 
,,,,PogChamp
,,,,That was sick asf
,,,,"What SR are all your Alts at? You are dope as fuck at doomfist, but I counted at least 3 different accounts, so I'll guess some of those were well below your true skill level.I sit at mid diamond and placed in low plat last season, playing down is stupid easy."
,,,,lowest is like 4250 right now but most usually sit between 4350-4500
,,,,Plz get some better music you trash fuker
,,,,I'm sorry but none of this was impressive. There's about as much mechanical skill involved in these clips as is required to peel a banana. 
,,,,10/10 satire
,,,,"Okay but you still contribute nothing to the team, these are just clips show an entire game bet you lost most of them because you are out playing street fighter at their spawn while they cap the point, you might also be #1 because no one plays doomfist "
,,,,why are you so angry
,,,,How do you get 4000+ by contributing nothing to the team?
,,,,Envy leads to the dark side
,,,,They have cookies 
,,,,no you're not. ever heard of chipsa?
,,,,Don’t get me wrong your fucking amazing at doomfist better then what I’ve seen most of the time and deserve the title but I thought Chipsa was the best doomfist 
,,,,"I hate  people that brag about being a good onetrick on a hero that is out of meta and basically useless, but some of those plays were insane "
,,,,"I'm pretty sure once your skill gets to the level of OP, the meta isn't relevant."
,,,,Rank 1 doomfist means youre master or gm rank and no fucking way thoose games are from gm/master players. Youre obviously trooling quickplay.
,,,,I didn't know Doomfist had a hidden passive that makes the competitive round score UI show up in quickplay.
,,,,what the fuck do you have eyes

,,,,"Zen, the most far-removed character from the others in the game.Zen mentored Genji and was the brother of Mondatta, whom Widowmaker killed while Tracer attempted to stop her. And while it sounds like I'm making tertiary connections at that point, note that Tracer feels guilty enough to bring it up with Zen. Point being, there's meetings and crossed paths. And they're good about doing that, especially for new heroes. But they missed one.No, people forget who the most detached character is because they love her, and because others talk about her because they know who she is. But she's not part of Overwatch or Talon, and she's not connected to anyone who is. She has no camraderie, only another celebrity that recognized her (and her him) in mutual appreciation for each other's work. Her only connection to the lore is the Omnic Crisis, which she fought without the assistance of any current hero, even though she was part of an organized unit that has otherwise gone unmentioned.The one Overwatch character with no real connection to anyone else is D.va."
,,,,The one Overwatch character with no real connection to anyone else is D.va.We really need some sort of D.VA lore at some point. Hopefully next year?
,,,,"They've been really good about anticipating our ""hey, you know what's missing?"" comments and delivering a few months later."
,,,,"A bitter/evil healer, new map and a CRAPLOAD of non-seasonal stuff, yeah. I'm kinda hoping Uprising/Lore event either gives us more inter-talon interactions or D.Va lore because god knows she needs it."
,,,,But D.Va serves the most important role of them all.Weeb gamer bait.
,,,,I don't mind catering to the usual peanut gallery with a hero when 1) you're doing a really good job of also appealing to almost everyone else and 2) you gave them a character who receives attention from the same crowd IN-UNIVERSE and has successfully made that her least important accomplishment.
,,,,"Symmetra and Lucio also seem to be quite removed (Lucio stole from Vishkar and Vishkar built in the slums of Brazil so they have a connection, but I don't see much connection to anyone else)Junkrat and Roadhog are their own thing.But yeah D.Va is out on her own (unless the Junker skin actually implies something)."
,,,,"I agree, yeah. I wanna say they even said her and Mercy were going to have an interesting interaction way back at Blizzcon, but that has yet to be seen. At the least, I think she could use some interactions with Reaper, Mercy, and Doomfist. Beyond that, Sombra and Ana. "
,,,,"I assume they’ll get added in down the road, but yeah, it is disappointing for the interactions to not be in the game yet. "
,,,,It’s very possible that we don’t have all the interactions recorded. The VAs don’t all come in at once in record due to their crazy schedules. So if we’re getting more maybe they’ll be in the Blizzard World or Lunar New Year patch
,,,,She should've had something with Mercy and Sym
,,,,"It would be awesome if she proposes radical ideas to the more educated heroes, but she’s turned down for being too impulsive and/or idealistic."
,,,,"I liked the Zenyatta Interaction :( I liked his passive aggressiveness.But I agree. She really needs more interactions with other heroes like Doomfist, Reaper, Mercy, Genji etc."
,,,,Sassyatta did it better. 
,,,,"Maybe they are holding off from putting them into the game, They could have some interactions but they could be waiting until they give us a proper story update like a comic or a cinematic so they can avoid spoilers/misinformation.I have no evidence of course but we have no idea whats going on behind the scenes at Blizzard."
,,,,Orisa had more interactive voicelines added later on. I presume the same will happen with Lady Moira.
,,,,At this point I'm expecting to get more lore of any kind by 2020
,,,,"Now you know how Symmetra feels.Nah, but seriously Moira has connections to so many people that its surprising she has so little interactions. They might added later on though, they do that sometimes."
