"239","Typically, people talking about performance of windowed versus full screen are doing so under the assumption that ""windowed""is shorthand for ""borderless window filling the full screen"".Full screen takes advantage of some OS optimizations for applications in this mode, but earlier implementations of these optimizations would often lead to games crashing or behaving poorly when switching between programs (alt-tabbing to check a guide while the game is still running, for example).  These problems have largely been solved in modern games and operating systems, so there is generally very little reason to opt for borderless windowed anymore if you're playing on the whole size of your monitor.With that background out of the way, we can move on to your question.  Yes, you are losing those full screen optimizations running in windowed mode, but this is vastly overshadowed by the fact that your graphics processor needs to render fewer pixels due to the lowered effective screen resolution your game is playing at.  This makes a huge difference.  If every frame is that much smaller (in resolution) it's much easier for a system under strain to make more of them, faster.

It’s more important to hit the shots that count (finishing a fleeing enemy, shutting down an ult, landing a Widow headshot against their Mercy, etc.)Stat sites like Overbuff, Overwolf, etc. can give stat ranges for each hero in each competitive tier if you want to compare yourself to other players.

"301","That's just natural :P We all start somewhere so don't stress about it too much. Try out all the different heroes so you at least get a feel for what their kits do. After that, see which ones you like and focus on them. Most of the skills you need for overwatch will just naturally come with time and experience. Try to hone your general awareness, whether that be listening to what's going on around you, what threats are present, looking at the kill feed to see how your team is faring, what ults your team has up, what ults the enemy team might have up, etc. Having good awareness will lead to having good game sense.Always try to play the objective, the objective is the number one priority and it is also what many newer players neglect. Learn how to analyse the objective timer as it can be confusing to understand for beginners. For example, overtime will start to tick if you guys are on 99% and the other team is on 0 but still contesting. Whilst your gut reaction may be to panic and try to touch point - that is often the wrong decision. Instead, realise that your team only needs 1% more and it is ok to let the enemy cap the point in order to regroup as a team and push together. On the flip side, recognise which overtimes mean TOUCH the point and STAY on the point using whatever means possible. It is all too common to pull a c9 - meaning that a team has the opportunity to contest the point but don't do so and lose the game. If you notice that your team is pushed all the way up but the point hasn't been capped, sit on the point and cap it yourself. If you notice there is nobody on payload, let your team know or sit on it yourself. Trickling is BAD. Don't trickle, don't let your team trickle, spam that group up button when you notice people are just going onto the point one by one and dying. Sorry about the long ass essay, I'm on a flight atm so I have a lot of time.

"304","I'd caution against overlooking the ""easy"" heroes when you're starting out, especially if your goal is to improve.  A simple kit frees up brainpower to focus on fundamentals like positioning, awareness, target prioritization, ult tracking, and the like.  If you're in bronze, I can guarantee that you need to work on these things (heck, we all do), and the depth in these simple kits may surprise you.  Soldier 76 has many animation cancel abilities and advanced movement, for example, as does Reinhardt.Of course, if mechanical complexity is fundamental to you having fun, by all means play what brings you joy.

But they never explain what an Omnic is and they never explain whether the Omnic's are good or bad (or what relevance they have to the Overwatch story). You get from context that there was a war against the Omnic's so the casual observer would assume that Zen is a bad guy, probably.

"672","Hi all, I'm the author of this guide. I had originally written it for /r/overwatchuniversity (but had also always intended for /u/vandalmunroe to use it for his website) and people there were saying that 'communication is a net negative,' so I wrote a 'small' edit to my original post. I'll copy it here in case anyone wants to read that as well. In the comments, some people have been saying that they have felt that communicating only tends to tilt people. This can be because of a variety of things. Those people could have already been tilted and are venting their frustrations on the 'tryhard' (shouldn't we all be tryharding in competitive?) for example. It could also be that the player who is communicating is being too condescending or argumentative about it (often without realizing it) even though they do mean well. Then there is also the fact that some people are just playing their own game and have next to zero interest in actually working with their team, which (to me) is entirely the wrong way of going about a competitive OW game.If you queue up in competitive (which is by all accounts the most 'serious' way of playing the game for most players) in Overwatch, which is a multiplayer only team based game, I think that there should be a certain willingness to be a team player and work with your team. I am not saying that people should be playing heroes they really don't want to play or have no playtime on and be the lackey of their team, but there is a middle ground between that and blatantly ignoring the input of your team and just doing whatever the hell you want, including getting mad when someone does want to work as a team. This is partially covered in the 'mind your attitude' part of the guide though.Either way: it is important to get a feel for your team. If a certain player really doesn't handle your suggestion to switch off well then it's probably best to leave it at that, for example. Millions of people play this game and as such there's tons of different personality types behind those screens. Much as in real life it's important that you are able to 'read the room'.It is also possible to 'force yourself' on your team too hard. It is fine to communicate regular stuff (basic health callouts, ults, ...) but if you try to babysit your team a little too hard then there's a possibility that that doesn't sit well with the enemy team. Remember that no one elected you as their leader, so it's not your responsibility to steer the team and have all of them play to your ideas. If you are calling the shots a bit and people are listening and agreeing, then great, keep doing that. But if you feel like your team wants to go a different route then go along with the team. It's a team game, there is no set hierarchy, you're all on the same level of the leadership pyramid.There is also definitely the possibility that you are communicating too much. As with almost anything, moderation is key. There's no need to call out that McCree used his roll when he exited spawn, or that Tracer used one blink, for example. Aside from that, some groups of people naturally prefer a more laid back style of comms (just saying whatever is really necessary) whilst some will have no problem with a more 'professional' style of communication. Again; reading the room is important.Edit conclusionI don't want to pull any rank card or sound like a grandpa, but I've been playing competitive games for the better part of a decade now and communication is something which leads to good results (or at least causes no extra troubles) 95% of the time in my opinion. It's definitely very important to 'read the room' when you're playing with randoms though, and that is a skill that will come with time. Some people are 'beyond help' (people who are already tilted from a loss streak, very selfish/arrogant players, trolls, ...) but that's just the nature of people, that's not a downside of communicating in itself.It is important to also look at yourself as well. If you find that more than half of your teammates get angry with you after a while then it's probably best to take a look at how exactly you're communicating. No matter how well you mean it, you could be coming off as a smug bastard to them or you could be yelling stuff which really doesn't matter at all.All in all I firmly believe that being able to communicate properly (which also means knowing what you can and can't say to certain teammates and so on) is a very valuable skill. You don't have to be talking all the time (I don't do that either) and as with everything there are nuances to it. You're playing with real people with real feelings and personalities after all, not with robots. Some people prefer to be silent and just listen in and that's fine as well, but I wholeheartedly disagree with the notion that getting on comms somehow always (or the majority of the time) has a negative effect on your team. That doesn't rhyme with my experiences and it doesn't rhyme with what I see on the streams I watch every day either.",0.233333333333333,"FALSE"

Not to be egotistic myself but I have good game sense and understand game mechanics and play well. Am I good? that's another question.and the only reason I did start doing this is because I read a top post on here the other day that leaving voice chat helps you have a better game due to the cut off from the chatter.P.S what also doesn't help is that I play off meta heros. so people assume i'm throwing.",0.272727272727273,"FALSE"
"675","I am not against people who don't talk themselves. I'm of the opinion that it's always better to at least make super necessary callouts (like a flanking Reaper with ult or whatever who hasn't been seen by anyone in your team) but I understand that there are people who'd rather not talk due to a variety of reasons. Completely shutting off the chat of other people by default is something which I think is rather silly though. Initially it might help you to focus on your game if you just turn everything off, but remember that OW is a team game and you team's input can genuinely mean the difference between winning or losing a game.I also think that being able to listen to team chat whilst playing the game is a skill which needs to be trained before you can do it perfectly. If it's really so beneficial to just mute everything then why don't pro teams do that, for instance? Another comment on here went something along the lines of 'how is communicating with my team gonna help me win a 1v1 with a flanker' and the answer is that it won't help you win that 1v1 in that instance (though communicating it may save your life due to someone peeling for you or whatever) but to me that's a bit of a lazy (I don't mean that offensively) way of thinking. For example; I play soccer. Why would I try to look up at the field as often as possible when running with the bal when I can just look at my feet the entire team, making it way easier? This just to say that, yes, it might be easier to look at your feet, but you'll lose valuable info on the position of your teammates and the opposition. Once you've practiced enough it becomes second nature to look up as much as possible as opposed to looking at your feet.The same goes for OW. Yeah, it might be easier to shut everything off and 'just focus on your own play' but that comes at the cost of not hearing possible gamesaving calls, not being able to call out very important stuff which can win you games, ... I've been gaming for a long time and now I can easily talk and listen to other players without it being a major hindrance to me. You can look at players like Emongg if you want an example of a player who is constantly talking and listening and still performing very well. Now of course if your team consists of a bunch of trolls blaring music and farting noises through their mics whilst raging at each other then you can turn it all off, but I think shutting off communications entirely by default isn't the right way to go. TL;DR: I'd say shutting off all comms by default is a mistake. It might be easier for you to play without all of these 'distractions' but once you get used to it it's not a distraction any longer. Perhaps a silly example to illustrate my point: it's easier to ride a bike with training wheels because you're not being distracted by the whole 'trying to stay upright' thing, but if you want to become a decent/pro cyclist you're gonna have to take off the training wheels sooner or later.",0.314285714285714,"FALSE"

Probably my funnest games I have ever played in comp.Before the rounds I seen we went the basic 2/2/2 comp right off the bat which was great!! So I told the flanker to flank the team and the rest stick together behind our Rein and they all said ""understood"" with the quick msgs.Then when we started I made all the callouts of the enemy flankers and my tanks helped me out Rein saved me several times. Oh forgot to mention I was playing Moira.Also I stuck to being positive through the whole match thanking for the heals from our Mercy of Lucio, (they swapped for some rounds).

I only watched a few of his streams in the super early days so thats what i’m basing this off of. I was wondering if someone who was not already established or a pro ever had a chance of making it. FWIW I left thinking “he’s trying too hard” (to make it.) Welp.But anyways, imagine instalocking Junk and not saying a word back then. You just communicated ALOT and it wasn’t good.

"686","Seems like a long way of saying ""Tell Hanzo to switch and then blame him if you lose anyway.""Seriously though, I feel like the community, in general, can communicate reasonably well; but where things fall apart is when it comes to assessing the game/situation. It's unfortunately so incredibly common for people to scapegoat someone else or blame some outside force, get tilted and babyrage all over voice or text. I've watched so many games go from our favor to auto-loss due to people getting triggered after losing a team fight because they didn't get healed, or &lt;most off-meta hero&gt; didn't last-hit everyone so they don't show up in the kill feed or something stupid like that.I suppose reeling that in is part of the communication thing (and something you touch on), but it'd be rad if people would control those emotions entirely and not tilt at all.",-0.111111111111111,"TRUE"

"688","I actually started climbing again when I began to mute all the text and voice chats. Communication can help you win a game but talking and listening to the team distracted me so I couldn't really focus on what actually makes you climb. Not just winning games but improving yourself because that is what the skill rating represents.For example I won't learn how to beat a flanker by making a call out while losing focus on aiming. It might be easier for others to multitask talking/listening and playing but personally it helped me a lot to stop me from thinking more about what to say than about what to do.But note that I am playing flex support (all 5 healers) and therefore mostly don't need to communicate while picking a hero and also have enough information about my teams positioning because I can see their silhouettes.Another aspect is that you lose out on all the toxicity that might occur but of course also on all the opportunities to talk to awesome people which is one of the best parts of Overwatch.",0.692307692307692,"FALSE"

I honestly think that the biggest reason for me to ever leave plat and make it to masters is my shotcalling.

"693","Mind your attitude. As a general rule of thumb you should try to never react to something and let your frustration shine through. Creating a bad vibe in a team is the shortest way to a loss, because tilted people will always play worse. If your Mercy blatantly missed your multiple calls for healing and you were standing right next to her then you have every right to be a little upset, but don't let it shine through in your comms too much. It's okay to tell someone you think they did something wrong (and you should be able to take constructive criticism as a player in a competitive game mode) but never resort to flaming or any sort of abuse. There are people who are able to shrug stuff like that off, but mostly you will only generate an equally hostile response or cause people to start playing worse (i.e. 'tilting' them) and that is the shortest way to a loss.This is the most important piece of advice out the entire post. I've played way to many games where someone will mess up one tiny thing and people will instantly start to flame and tilt off of it. At the end of the day, its a game and we're all trying to have fun. Flaming others and becoming tilted over small mistakes shows you aren't mature enough to play in a competitive environment.
