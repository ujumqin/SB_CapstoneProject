Someone cursed me and hope I die of cancer, call me a troll even when I tried my best (It was not a ranked game and I in no mean talk to him/her even once too btw). Obviously I'm going to report him/her. It'd be nice to see toxic players being punished."
https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20752619458,How do I know if someone I reported gets banned?,NA,Actually There are plenty of gaming companies and non gaming companies that follow up with you on your reports and take them seriously.  Blizzard Korea even publicly named hackers they banned in Overwatch for aimbotting.  Not the same I know but you get the idea...
https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20752619458,How do I know if someone I reported gets banned?,NA,"First, I'd suggest you remove the player's name, as name and shame is against the rules.Second, you can't tell whether the player you reported get banned or not. Blizzard won't go and tell everyone who reported someone ""Hey, thanks, the guy is banned now""."
https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20752619458,How do I know if someone I reported gets banned?,NA,"I don't see why Blizzard should convene with reporters (they aren't the police, they are a company) about the status of players. I wouldn't feel comfortable with you having that kind of information about me in the least bit and I don't feel as though you should get special rights because you got offended/are salty and irrational.As for them being on your friend's list or not, well you don't have to wait on Blizzard to do something about that."

https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20752619458,How do I know if someone I reported gets banned?,NA,"It would be quite unethical to do so, you reported it and blizzard is the neutral party between you, and the accused. Anything that happens beyond that point is entirely between the accused and blizzard. Apart from that I believe blizzard would not ban/punish for a single game where that occured, unless the person was using a hack that was registered by ingame detections as well, and that is a good thing as anyone can have a moment where their composure slipped and by murphy's law push to talk was on during that time. KYS is a stretch and sounds like something they would do on a regular basis if they have no qualms with saying that though. Therefore any reports from within the same game should probably count less than from 2 seperate instances. If that doesn't satisfy your vigilante nature, think of it this way: If they are cheating, toxic, or any other blizzard ""offense"", by the sheer amount of players that player encounters while playing if he is doing something wrong, he will get punished in due time."

You're no better than that guy you're talking about.Edit: That said, I would really appreciate it if you got a message when logging into the main menu saying: ""A player you reported for [Report Reason (aka Spamming, Griefing)] has been suspended for XX hours/days/weeks"" similiar to how you get the ""Leaving Several games in succession will result in a penalty"" when leaving too many QP matches."
https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20752619458,How do I know if someone I reported gets banned?,NA,"OP, why do you care?If you've reported them, then there's nothing more for you to do.... you're done.  You get to go on playing the game and now the reported player is in Blizzard's hands.What's the point in continuing to focus on some random internet troll?  Yes, severe transgressions should be punished... however... the sooner you learn to let go, the better your experience will become."
