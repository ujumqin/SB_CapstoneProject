"28","https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760696925","Hanzo > Widow",NA,"Widow and Hanzo, while appearing very similar, are actually radically different skill sets. Hanzo is best at mid range, peeking corners, and spamming arrows. Body shots do 125 full charge, and his wall climb and sonic arrows provide useful situational benefits. Being a projectile, the arrows are actually somewhat easy to predict and avoid in comparison to widowmakers hitscan. 250 damage headshots vs 300 damage. Widowmaker is best at medium- long range. A hanzo close trumps you due to scattershot and quicker arrow charge. Widowmaker's hook is far better than wall climb, but its on a cooldown so it averages out imo. Try running from a winston or dva as hanzo... Try getting around reinhardt shield as hanzo... get to the top of the map as hanzo...  Killing pharah is FAR easier with widowmaker, as well as mercy and other high mobility characters minus scatter shot. Widowmaker and hanzo both have their situations that one is better than the other, but skill makes up the difference. A god tier widow will be useful where a ""decent"" hanzo is not, and vice versa. A widowmaker can down a roadhog in two shots; where hanzo needs three consecutive headshots to seal the deal. Is one better than the other? No. While both snipers, they both are different roles, and both perform incredibly different from each other."

Maybe like a tar bomb that if thrown at an enemy it will cause them to stick onto a wal or if you throw it on the ground and they walk on it then they are stuck in place.

Please Watchhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kDqZ_dsZAQ________Recently purchased a amazing new Ultrawide monitor however I've since learned that Overwatch does not support true 21:9 aspect ratio and instead crops the game to fit which actually ends up showing less than normal 16:9. Apparently Blizzard says it would be unfair and thus has implemented this janky version instead. Why are you crippling Ultrawide users by showing them less than 16:9 I'm baffled. I'm here to beg Blizzard to please reconsider. The real argument at hand here is if Blizzard is concerned about competitive play then why is no one discussing the other things that also give advantages like console users being able to play with mouse and keyboard or people with better internet giving them lower latency or monitor refresh rates giving better accuracy and smoothness. Why is that the people who have decided to upgrade their hardware to Ultrawides must chose whether or not to play with black bars or this severely cropped version. I find it rather baffling that every major title that has been release in the last 10 years has support for true 21:9 resolutions including other competitive shooters and mobas like CS:GO or HOTS yet somehow it's not okay in Overwatch. What makes Overwatch different from other competitive shooters that 21:9 is not okay here but okay everywhere else? What about Destiny 2 that just came out, I've been playing it and it looks amazing because it supports the real aspect ratio and is not cropped; even the pre-rendered cutscenes are in true 21:9 which I commend Bungie for because even games like Witcher3 give black boarders during cutscenes. The reality is that casuals players like myself simply just want to play the game and have fun and basically telling us that our hardware is unfair is silly. We aren't going to competitive offline tournaments where 16:9 is the standard so what is the big deal here? No one wants to play with black bars on their screen when every other game in the world including all other competitive shooters support real 21:9. Forget CS:GO, what about Gears, CoD, BattleField, Destiny2 all competitive shooters supporting 21:9. Overwatch is a freaking casual game, just let people enjoy themselves. Like others have pointed out in this thread how often would any of you people against 21:9 even run into players like me with Ultrawides when only 1% users even own one.Can we please get an update on this or will Blizz stay forever silent on this issue?"

As I've honed my aim well, I tend to atleast body shot them and force a recall. The really, really good tracers (the gm and top 500 ones I'm currently facing) I've just started playing against... yeah I'm struggling hitting them with MCREE (my other main) lmao.Good tracers are scary, and Mei is inconsistent for tracer even if you've greatly honed your aim. Some games I never hit tracer, while others I'm always headshotting them! They usually switch to pharah and focus me, I still shoot them down tho.Now, as for buffs, people have the absolute wrong idea for Mei I feel. IN FACT most of these suggestions come from people who dont even play Mei or realize her true role, or why Mei isnt the most ideal pick.As buzzinate pointed out, mobility skills should be reduced in terms of speed and distance, not completely removed that's basically hacking your enemy with primary fire. That would make Mei way too good, and then people will bandwagon her, yeah no thanks, don't want my Mei being a mustpick. I prefer the confined community that is being a Mei main. Now, Mei is weighed down due to the heavy gear she wears,  I understand that but I feel her speed could be increased just a bit, for QOL. Nothing major.  Really, Mei just needs minor-median QOL changes, nothing as severe as a rework please. A new ability maybe? Ultimate buffs definetly. Overall Mei just needs the small things, such as primary fire becoming hitscan (literally every other beam is). Icicles should stay the same besides an increased rate of fire. Cyrofreeze could be changed to stall less, but be more efficient such as providing a reload. I HATE people who pick Mei just to stall an inevitable loss, by the way her winrate is negatively impacted by this since people tend to go over that stat often.Mei doesn't need much to be in a better spot, people who suck as mei will still suck. Good meis can enjoy a better experience, and new people should be more welcomed to try out mei.

I actually treat her more as a tank (controlling space, drawing aggro, etc.) I do think becoming an anti flanker is something that would help her a lot. I think overall Mei is in a difficult place, not because she is UP. But because she inconsistent. There is a big thread that details a lot of these inconsistencies. But in terms of her anti-flanking potential, I think a less development intensive way to address the issue is to make her slow debuff kick in earlier and last longer. As it stands most heroes once you get into range with them, they are easily frozen. Getting in range and surviving the enemy team is the difficult part. So extending the time the slow debuff last will have an impact on Tracer and Genji who usually get exposed but swift strike/blink out but everyone else's match up will remain the same."

You're assuming that all people beyond yourself have an equally likely chance of leaving a game, and that only one person will leave the game during its match. This in and of itself is flawed logic as anyone who has ever been in a match with a leaver knows that other people can also leave during the match. However, let's ignore that. Your supposition is that for every leaving match there are 11 members who might leave. 6 out of those 11 members on the opposing team. 5 out of those 11 on your team. Or (because you were not kind enough to calculate your own proofs) there is a 54.5% chance of the leaver being on the opposite team and a 45.5% chance of that leaver being on your team. (Those are good odds for a casino, bad odds for just about anything else.)Of course,  your argument also hinges on the belief that oneself will never be the leaver. This is statistically dodgy at best as, should you lose power or connection, you yourself will be the leaver. This makes it back to 50% chance you will be on the leaving team. You cannot discount yourself from a calculation because there is a chance, no matter how slim, that you will be the leaver. And each person similarly has a different chance they will leave a game - whether through a statistically worse internet connection or a habit of leaving. In reality, the odds of you having a leaver on your team would be calculated by each player's individual leaving percentage times the 1/12 chance they will be placed on your team versus another. (Added together to make a full team of course.)This, by the by, is likely to change based on the rank you're in, what server you are playing in, and other factors. TL;DR: No. It isn't.

""It doesn't translate into the real world that well."" That is why. I duo queue, so according to his ""math"" I have an even less likely chance of encountering leavers on my team. However, in my experience this season, I have encountered more ""leavers"" on my team. If you consider that most of them returned and were therefore disconnects, I have encountered an equal amount of leavers. That does not add up in the most basic of examples weighed in his favor. That is why people dislike it, it is literally a waste of time even humoring this conclusion that weights exactly one variable. If you pass your opinion off as fact and hide behind a technicality, that is what happens and I am surprised so many sheep actually agree with this juvenile reasoning. People who are not privy to ""ooh, that is technically true"" are going to call out the fallacy because it is not true. There are literally hundreds upon thousands of variables to consider at the end of the day. Ending the story at, ""you are not going to leave, so that means they might be more likely to leave"" is erroneous af.Beyond that, let us go into the delusional mind of a Junkrat main and for one second pretend that this drivel is actually objective fact. In this fantasy land where 2 + 2 = 6 and this guy confirmed the math, so it must be true, leavers are more likely on the enemy team. And that leaves us with a big so what? Who cares? That is not going to make me feel better when my wins and losses are invalidated because someone left. Free win, free loss, it does not matter. In the case of a free win, I get 15 out of 3000 competitive points and in the case of the free loss, I go down in SR and wait until they get a leaver to bring it back up to neutral. My point is that his, um... observation (I am tired of alluding to this half-baked assumption as math) means nothing. It is of no concern to anyone and most people could deduce this general guideline for themselves. That could be another logical reason for down-votes. It is not even worth considering."

This should be a given.Close in on the distance enemies can hear her announcing shes around by half. There is no reason she has to be 15 meters behind an enemy to hack them.Sugar Skull above hacked enemies. Please? Pretty please? Its a visual queue for your team to say ""HEY SHOOT THIS DUDE""And the bullet spread. I wouldn't normally ask for this, but Sombra is in such a bad spot it would do nothing but help her. If I am shooting at a Pharah who is about 15-20 meters away, the RNG of her gun basically makes it gambling. Pharah could have 20 health, I can unload half a clip and not touch her. That is bad. Sure, I shouldn't be able to blow her out of the sky, but I should at least be able to land 3 bullets out of 60.Don't get me started on how inconsistent EMP is with stopping Ultimates mid cast. You have to hit EMP THE MILLISECOND Genji/Soldier/Bastion/Rein or whoever starts the Ultimate. If you have even a slight delay or are off by litteral milliseconds, EMP does nothing to counter a cast.The allowance window needs to be slightly bigger.Sombra needs help. A lot of it."

She isn’t “bad”, per se, she just requires a lot of mechanical skill, game sense, and most of all, a reliable team.But some QoL changes would be amazing. She doesn’t need a damage change, like a lot of people ask for, but just some things to make playing her feel smooth. I agree that stealth feels “meh”, and hacking feels unreliable.

Tracer can blink in your face three times and blast you with one clip, Junkrat can launch himself up in the air shoot you once then throw mine at you and boom you’re dead, Genji can quickly shoot a few Shurikens at your head, swift strike through you, turn around and use your own abilities against you with his Deflect, but yet Sombra can’t come out of Stealth without saying an entire sentence having the entire team notice her before she can even shoot one bullet?? Umm.. HELLOOO!! Shes a STEALTH HERO.. thats what they do, catch you by suprise!! That doesn’t make her OP, that just fits her playstyle, if you know theirs an enemy Sombra, be aware of her flanking you!! It’s not rocket science to make a 180° turn and fight back, especially when your team is there with you. I mean cmon, Blizzard acts like Sombra coming out of Stealth turns her weapon into a giant nuclear laser that melts your insides.. Sombra deserves to at least be on level with Genji and Tracer people have been saying that for over a year now if anything, it's only helping her get out of the blackhole she's stuck in.Also D.VA is not a problem at all it’s very easy to get her out of her Mech, you weren’t paying attention to the problem, the point is that D.VAs little pellets across the map take you out of Stealth with 1 damage which is ridiculous, Sombras abilities get canceled more than the enemies shes trying to hack, that’s just not right. Sombra can be very effective being a disruptor dealing a bit of damage than teleporting away to farm her EMP, but her ultimate should not be her #1 priority when it comes to good viability. Sombra is only viable because of her EMP, hence why everyone literally uses her as a Support, even the OWL uses her to fill a Support Slot because all she can do is farm her EMP and give heals, while not dealing enough damage.  Sombra needs power shifted away from her constant EMP farming, and more power onto her actual kit so she can be more viable on her own without having to hold her teammates hands after she spent the entire game teleporting back and forth intentionally taking damage to gain ultimate charge?? Not to mention her Machine Pistol spread.. how is she supposed to be the hero that “finishes people off” if she can’t even get to the low HP enemy thats most likely behind their teammates, and theirs a 99% chance that you’ll get shot out of Stealth forcing you to teleport away, not even getting the finish on them. Even if you don’t have to get near them, its not like you can shoot them at a distance either, her Weapon spread is ridiculous so the bullets are hardly ever going to hit them to finish them off, Sombras gun acts like a target thats 10 feet away is actually far away on another planet.A stealth hero like Sombra has so much potential yet she acts like a broken record going back and forth. There was even a bug when she was first released that allowed players to get rid of the Stealth delay and it worked fine and felt way smoother than what it is now and it wasn’t OP at all. And ofcourse, Sombra is already pretty good, but any hero can be good for the little amount of players that invest so much time into playing them, but that doesn’t make the hero good or the other 99% of the playerbase.Sure, Blizzard might’ve said they don’t want Sombra to be an assassin, but that was a year ago, look how their plan turned out, all Sombra is, is an EMP bot that is counted as a Support Hero. It makes no sense. It’s been over a year and Sombra has been more worthless than Doomfist considering her release date.Blizzard has to change Sombra, they didn’t like how Mercy and D.VA were Resurrect bots and Defense Matrix bots, so they reworked them and even gave them new abilities, Sombra needs the same treatment."

As was originally promised when they announced the 2nd mine buff. Each mine needs to do max 80-90 damage. You will see Junkrat mains posting in threads around and saying how the ""only thing he needs is an ult charge nerf"" which is basically their attempt to compromise on a nerf because they know that it is coming but the true thing that needs nerfing are mines. And a slight ult charge nerf. By reducing the damage on mines, it will also reduce the speed of charging of his ultimate. Because currently, mines are what enable him to do so. He simply throws a mine into a group of enemies and boom, 120 damage flat to everyone in the radius. Then he throws an another one. He shouldn't be able to deal that much guaranteed damage. Currently, it is the by far the best source of burst damage in the game. And he has 2 of them. Damage that would otherwise likely be healed away. It means that as soon as 200 HP hero loses 40% of his healthpool to anything, he is likely dead. To a skillless ability. And he can even combo you with mines only, but it's rarer. By reducing the mine damage to 80, he still keeps his grenade + mine combo. He loses the trap + mine combo but it is rarely used anyways. The only time it's used is on the start of the round. But even that can be saved simply by buffing the trap. Or modifying the mine so that it deals more damage to trapped enemies only."

Literally trap doesn't get as much value after the start of a game. Because, after the start of the game: You're aware they HAVE a Junkrat. You become more cautious. The only time you ever will step into a trap is if Junkrat is putting them down during a larger brawl. You'll not be paying attention then...but every other time it's pointless.EVEN IN GOLD/SILVER!

For balance reasons.- Grenade + Mine is a much more frequent and consistent combo- Junkrat's survivability and mobility goes way up because he can use a ConcMine every 4 seconds to engage/retreat.This is pretty close to what we're trying with him, and what will likely be on the PTR when it comes back up. Currently on our internal builds Junkrat has 2 charges of his Concussion Mine. This allows you to do all kinds of cool stuff like launch yourself into a fight and still have a charge to escape with, or launch yourself up into a Pharah and still have a charge to try and kill her with. Previously this was possible before but you had to plant one on the ground and then wait for the cooldown to come back before doing this. That is still possible, which allows for a triple jump now if you want/need that, but now it is a lot more reliable to do with 2. It has been a ton of fun to play with so far.We're also looking at making his ult a bit better. We're experimenting with a movement speed increase or a health increase on the tire. We wouldn't do both things but in either case it should be more reliable to use in more situations.So, yeah. This was what was originally hinted at. And then it never happened."

Counters to Junkrat include: Pharah, Zarya, D.Va, a good Widow, a good Genji... he has counters, but the most reliable way of dealing with him is altering playstyle. Don't linger in chokes, don't go into enclosed spaces...

When getting dived by a Winston, his jump usually destroys any mine you have ready. I'm just telling you the facts mate. Maybe Junkrat isn't the problem but you should consider switching heroes or altering your playstyle when you encounter him?

There's not really a TLDR, but if you want to get the gist of it, skim through the bolded areas.Hi Guys. I’ve been hesitant to post this thread, and instead wanted to wait until after Blizzcon to do so. There’s been a huge surge of concern over Symmetra’s place in the game, so much so that there are 3 Megathreads (all from people in masters, with obvious game sense) on making her more supportive in the general forum, and a reddit thread with 3000+ upvotes. https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759249296?page=1https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20758668065?page=1https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759257002?page=1https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759220930?page=1https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/7afy3b/the_change_for_symmetra_we_didnt_know_we_needed/?utm_term=b41127a9-d761-42ca-93eb-d750b12c3337&amp;utm_medium=search&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=Overwatch&amp;utm_content=1After hearing the recent Q&amp;A regarding Symmetra, it’s kind of clear that the developers are somewhat unsure of her place in the game, and so I’m hoping that this thread will concisely summarize her issues as well as give the developers clear knowledge of how to fix her, rather than recategorizing her. Blizzcon Q&amp;A:Any plans to make Symmetra more viable in competitive? Maybe healing abilities?Symmetra doesn't really fit well in the support category, but doesn't fit in defense either. In the future we might need to revist the categories to better accomodate changes with the game.Symmetra doesn't see much play in high competitive, but her recent toolkit change brought some interesting changes that made her more viable.Please, please, developers. It’s obvious you listen to us, otherwise a Talon Healer wouldn’t have been the next hero despite the massive demand for her. The community obviously wants her to be more supportive. Recategorizing her will not fix her fundamental issues when there are currently better, more intuitive options in the game for her niche (junkrat), as well as more supportive options for her niche coming as well (moira).From the Patch concerning her rework:""We wanted to address two main issues with Symmetra. First, on the whole, we felt that she didn’t feel active enough. Second, due to the nature of her Teleporter, she felt weak in certain situations on different maps and game modesTo address the first point, we replaced her more passive Photon Shield ability with a much more active ability: Photon Barrier. Now, Symmetra can help lead the charge on offense or help shut down a big push on defense by actively blocking damage for your team. For the second point, we noticed players would often switch off of Symmetra once they found themselves in a situation where her Teleporter wasn’t as useful. For example, when playing her on defense on an Assault map, players often used her to defend the first capture point, then quickly switched to another hero if that point fell. To help her feel more useful in more situations, we've given her an alternative to her Teleporter. The Shield Generator is just as important for the enemy to deal with, but is useful in more situations. .""This is important to note, as she is the most passive support out of all 5, and she is also the most situational. She is not viable on attack, as the intention of the rework. The first rework failed its intended purpose.You can read through this or skim to the bolded sections. While a lot of people argue that Symmetra is strong within her niche. That is precisely the issue with her. When she was most viable was within her Niche on chokes such as Hanamura, Eichenwalde, and Volksaya defense. There were numerous complaints on how hard chokes were to break through, so developers made several balancing adjustments, both to the maps, and characters who had either abilities or mobility to deal with the chokes. From that point onwards,  new map development gave a lot of alternative pathways and elevation that lessened her Niche's effectiveness and gave numerous easy options for counterplay, not to mention she’s not very viable outside of her niche, either.The point? The newest maps, newest characters, and newest buffs to heroes mean that her original Niche is shrinking, and her viability outside that niche is dismal if not compromising to the team. AKA: She’s not relevant to the current version of the game.The elephant in the room: She is the utility support, however, she is the only support whose utility mechanics are not readily available for use (speed, discord, damage boost) while the other support who has utility on cooldown has two highly active, flexible utility abilities that have a variety of uses that outclass Photon Barrier, and have less counters than her turrets do.  The other issue is that all of these support alternatives not only have better utility in their actual kit (not taking into account ultimates), but all the other support utility is in conjunction to healing. She was designed as a damage mitigating, utility support, that defends the backlines; however, almost all of the support in her kit comes from her ultimate, which makes her the only character who is balanced entirely around the merit of her ultimate- which is one of her design flaws, if this patch from Blizzard is any indication:Game-changing ultimate abilities were coming up a bit too frequently. This change helps keep them in check while still allowing them to be powerful. (universal nerf to ultimate charge)If a character is balanced around an ultimate, then it is likely that their kit is lacking. Symmetra has the lowest ultimate costs in the game, and can keep her ultimate up indefinitely. This should raise concerns as to what part of her kit makes this necessary in her design. They wanted her to more engaging in the rework, with more of a capacity for proactive and reactive engagement, but her kit has most of the most passive abilities in the game. Also important to note, if all of her her supportive merit is funneled into her destructible ultimates, she will always lose to Zen/Lucio, who don’t need their ultimate or to keep a structure alive to be supportive. Not only that, but her supportive capacity was originally her E, which rightly means that her original design did not involve a passive ultimate to provide support.Please, complete her kit. We know this is something you’re capable of doing. Within the last month, you completed Mercy’s kit due to the feedback of DPS mains. This is feedback from the people who play the character. Please fix her.She doesn’t  NEED  to heal, but she suffers from an incomplete kit as a support character. (if you need proof she's a support) Luminums videos show her potential as a support, but watching his videos often makes it clear to me that her kit is just not as cohesive as the other characters in the game, even the defense characters which skeptics seem to be convinced she is. His best plays are supportive plays, so she obviously has potential as a support. She just plays more like an offensive support, similar to Zen.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1GvmBQk8-shttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flWwBFCTjsUhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBbe7ylCy18(this was patched but shows how he needs high game sense, and to be innovative to a crazy level to succeed with her limited kit) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sJwuH1BMwY(this video shows the potential of team flanks at 4:10) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YhsywtY2OM(and this video shows why symmetra falls short as a support… she needs her team to support her for her to support them. She’s more follow-through dependent than any other support because she lacks support in her actual kit, but people will troll you because they see you as a “troll pick”) He makes great plays, saving his team from reinhardt ultimates, making team flanks, etc. But really, while that’s amazing, there’s not much he can do inbetween that except try to make picks. While other offsupports like lucio/zen, have their utility up (speed/discord) in addition to no cooldown, no ultimate options for heals (heal aura/harmony orb).Quality of Life adjustments for Symmetra are necessary, but if that is all she receives, she likely won't have a place in the game as the game evolves.The best, and most commonly suggested Quality of Life suggestions are:Turrets: Reduce the delay in placing and ""activating"" the turrets after you deploy them, as well as remove the slow that Symmetra is afflicted with when placing them.Ultimates: Let them be seen through walls for teammates, as well as willful deconstruction of her barrier generator so a skilled Symmetra can change her nesting location, similarly to how a widowmaker will change her sniping location. Let her deconstruct her teleporter to redeem some of her ult charge if the charges are running low. Also, allow her to build her ultimates on walls and ceilings at slightly longer range, so her setups become less predictable.(via AConstelle) Remove the 5-6 second delay she has on gaining ult when her Shield Generator is destroyed. The delay isn't there for TP, but it is for Shield Gen for some reason, and 6 seconds is a lot of time for Sym. Also the blue line indicating the Shield Gen's radius would be swell.Photon Barrier: There have been numerous suggestions for this ability. Increase the charges on it, decrease the cooldown, give her more control over it. The biggest consistent complaint I've seen with this ability is the fact that Symmetra has a harder time contributing with this support utility than other supports have contributing with their utility that is often on a lower cooldown or does not have a cooldown while simultaneously being easier skills to contribute with. This ability needs to be able to compete with an offhealing slot, period. It’s her only active support ability. The other point I want to bring up is that she is the only support who has a viable alternative to rez, which a lot of people are concerned about.[Moderator edit - I removed the direct call-out to the Dev team.  The Feedback here is greatly appreciated but the idea of the forums is a discussion among players.

More than anything it's to shed light on the issues that Symmetra is facing and how she's becoming obsolete with the evolving nature of the game. These ideas are the kind of ideas Symmetra players wonder about when they think of ""viability"" in the sense that other characters have that fall under the category of support, without boxing her into something as arbitrary as a healer. I've tried to limit the amount of ""reworking"" suggestions in this thread, but at this point, I'm leaning more towards it due to her place in the evolving nature of the game and competitive team comps. If you have an idea you feel is within her playstyle and will bring her viability, please list it in this forum. Ideas that have been thrown out:(Kyleesie Ideas)New Features to Existing Abilities:Photon BarrierChange the shape of the barrier into a sphere so it can block damage from all angles, and fully protect someone running with it.Health readuced to 900 down from 1025.- OR -Provides 75 shields to any ally it comes into contact with. The shields decay slowly 3 seconds after leaving a 5 meter radius of the Turret projecting the barrierReddit Idea:Let her place supportive turrets.(The issue with this is it’s not as flexible as other support utility and is too area based. Which in the end would cause the same potential problems as before)My idea:Her Glove as a Secondary weapon, similar to torb and mercy, unlocks a new ability under the primary fire of this ""weapon"": Photon Shield (yes, bring it back)Channeled ability, resource meter of 12-15 seconds. 30 Yard range. Grants 40 barrier health to your target per second. Can give up to 50 extra health. When not channeling, will degenerate at a rate of 5 hp per second. Barrier health is the same mechanic used in sound barrier and doomfists passive, which is why I suggest using this mechanic as a ""psuedo-heal"". This would grant her a place in the game as the only support counter available to Ana's grenade. She'll still primary play as a defensive dps, but this will give her defensive support utility that helps sustain the team and the main healer, without actually making her a healer. The way that barrier health functions, it would work somewhere between healing and the original photon shield. That is, that instead of providing a flat hp bonus, it would give a max of 50 ""bonus health"", but since it's barrier health, any missing HP would have to be filled with Symmetra's resource meter degenerating barrier health (like doomfist) before the ""bonus"" hp would apply.These suggestions, or variations of it, are the most popular on the forums. I’d even be willing to have her gun range nerfed, as lower SR seems to hate it, in exchange for more utility.Basically the same as her old ability, but not a flat hp bonus. Since it’s barrier health, missing hp has to be given before giving the bonus.Lastly, this is a quote that I really like from one of the other very well thought out Symmetra threads (Kyleesie's thread) that I really enjoyed.  This basically sums up opinion on why on why it may be necessary to give her a ""pseudo-heal""/stronger damage mitigation, while staying true to the developers vision for her. You don't need to make her a healer! That's the beauty of it. You just need to make her sustain to the point the team doesn't miss an offhealer :)Comments: I know the developers intentionally designed Sym without any traditional healing. However, while I respect their philosophy to design a unique way for her to function as a support, I strongly feel that her inability to heal (especially while classified as a ""support"" hero) negatively affects how players perceive her in the game. Simply put, Symmetra confuses people. New players are unsure of what she is used for, and veteran competitive and pro players don't value her utility over other support heroes who can actually heal. As a result, Symmetra is stifled by negative opinions, and those who choose to play her receive an egregious and unfair amount of toxicity and blame.Ideas added later based on discussions within the thread:Mohock Ideas: Letting her be stronger anti-mobility by having turrets affect things such as Dash/Blink, allowing her to set the base of her ultimate in a predetermined location before she gets it.Crestren Ideas: Allowing her to have more buildables, such as bridges, elevators, or structures that grant support to the team.Dr.Fate Idea:: Symmetra is granted a passive that gives sustain, similar to Lucio but exclusively affecting shield HP pools."
"577","https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759380928","[MEGATHREAD-UNCAPPED] Symmetras place in the game",NA,"Here are some of my potential ideas that could improve her kit and make her more viable:Turret-Survivability:Give her turrets thermoptic camo like Sombras. The turret stays invisible until an enemy comes in reach, decloaks and shoots. After a few seconds out of combat they recloak again. This would allow for more flexible and creative traps and prevents Tracer/DVa/Reaper from shootgunsniping them across the map.Turret-Placement: Give her turrets the flying behavior like the shieldcore, but instead of getting destroyed by hitting a surface, the turret sticks to it. This would solve the immobility issue while placing them, they could be used to contest high ground more effective and they would be more viable to push a point. Bonus buff if they would start fireing midflight.Turret-Slowing: Slowing effects from the turrets (or Mei) could be applied to ""teleport""-abilities like Tracers Blink or Genjis Dash, resulting in a shortening of the traveling distance equivalent of the percentage the hero is slowed down. A 25% Movement speed reduction from one turret would lead to a 10,5m dash instead of 14m.Ultimates: Let her place the base plate of her ultimates in advance even with 0% on her ultcharge and activate them when they are ready. You would set up the base with Q and could change the placement at any time by building a new one in case you change your mind or they get destroyed. I would even disable their shields until they are activated so flankers could dispose of them quickly if discovered. Pressing Q with 100% ultcharge would bring up the same image as of now of the sg/tp and you can select to activate the existing base by looking up or build a new one by looking down towards the ground. This way, Symmetra players don't have to leave the battle for prolonged times to set up her ults at a good spot and they can be activated right as the fight breaks loose to get a better impact."
"578","https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759380928","[MEGATHREAD-UNCAPPED] Symmetras place in the game",NA,"To Mohock: I really like the turret slow ability. Mobility is uncontested in this game, and that's why characters like Mei, even with a phenomenal kit, are scarcely seen in the game anymore. Improving anti-mobility kits, especially when tracer and genji are uncontested as flankers in the pro scene, might be something this game desperately needs."
"579","https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759380928","[MEGATHREAD-UNCAPPED] Symmetras place in the game",NA,"Thanks^^I find it paradoxical that slowing abilities are way more effective against allready slow opponents but do next to nothing against mobile targets. The only thing that can counter tracers blink is sombras hack, i think this game could benefit from one or two more.My proposed change would apply the reduction to the momentum of a character instead of the absolute velocity. This would also make it better against charging reinhards, jumping winstons and rocketboosting pharahs while the immobile character interaction stays the same. To balance this change the turrets could get a little bit of damage reduced to emphasize the support aspect."

On top of that, slow down and increase the size of the barrier a bit. That way she can give tanks a small break when their defenses get overwhelmed. If they give her healing, she'll instantly become viable.If they do the rest of my suggestion, she should be some where between a tank, dps, and defense. Giving her team more flexibility on deciding if they want to got single healer, tank, or dps, without outright hurting the effectiveness of the team."
"581","https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759380928","[MEGATHREAD-UNCAPPED] Symmetras place in the game",NA,"I've played Sym for over 200 hours and she's carried me from about 1700 to about 60 points away from Diamond. One suggestion I've had for a while is to add a simple 1HP barrier to her turrets, as a barrier will always absorb the impact from blow no matter how much it does. This would prevent them from being destroyed by something like D.Va's ult, Rein charge, Genji's Swift Strike, Lucio's Boop, Junkrat's Concussion Mine, etc. It gives Symmetra more staying power because there are less ways to counter her turrets, which are her main mode of support, but they still only effectively have 2HP so any automatic weapon fire can still dispose of them quickly.Another is that Symmetra just needs to take less time to do things across the board. She takes too long to deploy turrets, which then also have to activate so around 2 seconds from deployment to activation time for a turret which makes her harder to use on attack since she needs so much setup time. Her photon barrier needs to deploy earlier in the animation and closer to Symmetra, there are so many times where I have perfectly timed a block only to have the Hook/Flashbang/Widow Headshot go through it and then the barrier floats away from my corpse.I also think an interesting buff would be to either have her alt fire charge faster or move faster. She has the only basic attack that goes through barriers at range and, while useful in its current state, can sum up to poke damage if they have two healers. I think allowing it to either move or charge faster would give Symmetra a better chance on attack as she would be able to deal massive, unforgiving amounts of damage to the enemy team. These are mostly just QoL suggestions, as far as I'm concerned. The only straight buff is the charge or movement speed, and I think that's pretty minor tbh. The only serious kit alteration I could think would be to re-add back the photon shield at 25 and let her stack that with her shield generator, with the caveat that the 25 shields disappear if she dies. That would allow Symmetra to have a somewhat better impact before she's able to get an ultimate up, but can be punished if she were to die."

A sphere photon shield does little to support her kills with the low range of her gun, while it does help her team move forward.

Aside from Luminum, Hoshi and Stevo, no one would be able to reach their level especially Luminum as his skilled plays are incredible with limited kit. But the level of blocking all the Tracer and Rein's ult, even using turrets to block Doomfist's Rocket Punch is extremely high, if you dont main her to at least Diamond, its impossible to do it.Recently, Moira is out and with her mobility, she can outplay Sym with ease. Believe me or not, Sym will start to fall back along with Torb (really, these two dont need to have their skin designed in WC, no one gonna pick them)Sometimes i feel i could have been in Master by spending 150 hours on another char instead of sym but i love her and seeing her at the bottom of the game and being hated by most of the community is really sad."

My issue with Symmetra is that her supportive potential is near non-existent if your team has no awareness. I included some of Luminums gameplay in my post to illustrate this. He was doing a phenomenal job attempting to support his team, but they weren't taking his openings and not letting him support. In turn, it was like he didn't do anything, even though he was working extra hard with his limited kit.Imagine if an entire character's kit was similar to Zarya's grav in the sense that it needs friendly follow up to actually do anything?

Up to two of these orbs can exist at once.

It also helps alleviate mobility to non mobile heroes (like Ana, Zen, Mei) so she can play a role in that and help her team move around better.

It'll take to long, and with the nature of OW being a reactive game; swapping is key. With roles being ambiguous, and dual nature (Dva is an offensive tank, Reinhardt is a defensive tank for instance) of several characters being a thing... heres a suggestion...HUBS. ADD SOCIAL HUBS. Every other Blizzard game has hubs; this is literally the only title that doesn't. So what this will do is allow players to find 6 stack groups easily without having to worry about insane queue times. So instead of hoping you dont get stacked with 5 dps mains (it happens), you can have a voluntary option to find a team that suits your needs instead of forcing you to be obligated to suffer through that.who this fixes - one tricks can find a team that supports them- teams arent forced to play with one tricks they dont feel are useful- teams arent forced to be put in roles they arent comfortable with (necessarily)All the while, keep the queue system the same, so if you just want to hop in, there it is. Minimal implementation coding, no game breaking mechanics changes, no queue changes, flex players get more options for teams, one tricks can find a team that works around their role, etc etc.  Theres literally zero downside to this that I can think of, open to critiques here."

Unfortunately they also come off as if they punish slower characters, since the slower heroes need good aim to take care of them.

What if tracer had 200 which is only 50 more hp, would she be balanced? no she'd be broken due to her mobility dps capabilities and what would be a average health pool, but genji has similar properties, except he has 200 hp, which doesnt seem balanced to me.Now im looking at this from a balancing logic standpoint and not because i have issues with him, except one maybe, which is even when i hook and shoot him in the head, hes able to dash away, climb up a wall and basically has a FREE ESCAPE  and i honestly The amount of escape he has for his hp is BROKEN and needs to be more punishable and im not going to deny, its very triggering but, by a balancing standpoint, it dosent make sense that genji, a flanker, has the same hp as a general dps hero.On Paper, it's actually pretty well balanced.Genji has 200hp because he doesn't have a Recall mechanic to heal him back up, Tracer effectively has her standard 150hp + whatever Recall heals back up on top of her mobility. Whereas - Soldier 76 has 200hp because he has a heal, Pharah has 200hp because she can fly and is nearly immune to a good bunch of the cast, McCree has 200hp because he has a stun and high damage. It's the fact that Tracer and Genji have more map control to get away with the things they do that make them stronger (in the right hands).Yea! And Sombra... she uh.... yea!"

Currently, we have four heroes/characters that are associated with Blackwatch, right? Reaper, McCree, Genji and Moira. What I'm thinking is that maybe, just maybe, we might be getting a new PVE based on these four characters. But this is just my thoughts and it'd kinda make logical sense when you come to think about it.In Moira's origin story, we're gifted with bits of information that relate to her experiments, mainly one that presents Gabriel Reyes looking at himself in awe while black-like smoke slither off his body, perhaps displaying his ability to wraith and shadow step. This would explain his power without relating to the fact that he got them when he died. Imagine it, Reaper, McCree, Genji and Moira in their Blackwatch related skins fighting off Omnics or any other type of enemy, just like in the Uprising mode. Now the biggest concern with this is that there's three offence heroes and one healer. In Uprising, we had the choice of one of each role. Tracer, Torbjörn, Reinhardt and Mercy. Now I can only assume that the map layout and game-mode will function through teamwork while causing havoc. Also, think of the interactions and the witty banter they'll share with each other.Obviously, I can't confirm nothing, this was just a thought that I had in mind of what might come in the future.
