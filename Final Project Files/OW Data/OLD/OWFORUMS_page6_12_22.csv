Don't just let them sit on your friends list without engaging them ever again... hit 'em up and say ""hey last session was fun, if you want to play again I'll invite you"".Once you've 4-5 session under your belt with a person, they'll become familiar enough that'll start developing a crew you can play with... and from there this game is great.  It's a TEAM game, and yet so many people forgo that aspect and try to do it alone.  That is why there are so many kids lashing out.... because it's easy to feel like you're back is against the wall when the entire other team is trash talking you, along with a few people on your own team.  It's enough to make you think ""wow this game sucks"" when it's actually a quality title.Anyway, when you've a 6-stack, those people can have your back.

Even the devs know what they're adovocating shouldn't be done in Competitive, yet they're not gonna take action. And with performace-based SR still being present in lower ranks, it will soon be filled with selfish and care-less players, becomeing the next QP where you can earn golden guns.

Anything that happens beyond that point is entirely between the accused and blizzard. Apart from that I believe blizzard would not ban/punish for a single game where that occured, unless the person was using a hack that was registered by ingame detections as well, and that is a good thing as anyone can have a moment where their composure slipped and by murphy's law push to talk was on during that time. KYS is a stretch and sounds like something they would do on a regular basis if they have no qualms with saying that though. Therefore any reports from within the same game should probably count less than from 2 seperate instances.

The concept of placements statistically is to correct misjudgements by the system. More precisely, you start in your previous season SR initially, but there's more uncertainty i.e. SR volatility. As you do your placements, the system tries to determine your most suited SR and as the placements pass, the system becomes more certain. In other words, there's a different outcome of losing 4 and then winning 6, with winning 4, losing 2, winning 2 and then losing 2. The degrees of freedom (uncertainty) decrease match by match, therefore the SR given/lost changes as well."

Highest ive seen anywhere anytime is mercy at 20% in gold.Without condoning or condemning the point of this thread-I feel there may be some confusion in regard to pick rate stats on your part. When you look at over buff and you see a pick rate stat, be it 4%, 8%, 16%, etc- That doesn’t mean they’re showing up 4, 8, or 16% “of the time”- as in 4/8/16 times out of 100. It means they’re typically comprising 4/8/16/whatever of the hero SLOTS in a game. There are 12 slots in a game. 100/12=8.33. So any time you see someone at around 8%, that means they’re almost ALWAYS going to be in a game. But there’s two teams. When you see heros such as mercy pushing 16%, this means it’s because BOTH sides are almost always picking her."

I'm not a Genji player. Having 22 hours in QP with Genji while being a Silver Portrait 2 star doesn't make me a Genji player. I suck with him.Look at the characters that have an advantage in a fight with Genji.-Mcree-Soldier-Winston-Pharah-Moira-Tracer-Zarya-Doomfist (once ALL his bugs are fixed)-JunkratThat's a decent amount of the cast. For some reason people will argue they don't have an advantage which still baffles me. Mcree is a good example.Deflect doesn't give Genji the advantage here. It can't when the Genji doesn't have the ride of way here. Mcree doesn't have to Flashbang until after Deflect is used. If he doesn't Deflect then you will just kill him. Baiting the Deflect with Mcree is super easy. You can by landing one shot on him which usually forces the Deflect or Melee to fake the Flashbang. You can even flash above or at his feet and be successful. If you get a Flashbang deflected back in your face it's almost always your fault.So I don't understand it.People like to say if he is good enough he has no counters. That's an outlier. I'm a Hanzo main. I have no counters at all if I'm on my game. That doesn't make Hanzo OP."

First off. Junkrats mines. Genji can deflect but still take the full damage by air bursting it before it reaches him. A mind deflected back at you is a user error. Junkrats trap is great against flankers including Genji. It's a great way to shut them down especially if they are targeting certain heroes like healers.

I wanted to make this post cause it seems ridiculous that for however long this has been going on, they've had little to no change in viability outside of their majorly agreed niche: Mei as an off-tank, Sombra as an off-support, and Symmetra as a defense hero. History of The TrifectaFor an entire year, Mei has been considered ""F-tier"" since her niche only functions either stall a point at the end of overtime, or to slow enemies that have no movement or protection abilities of any kind: Zenyatta, Roadhog, Ana, Bastion, Torjborn, McCree (kindof). That's only 6 heroes that don't have any real capacity to evade her freeze, and the ones that don't have some sort of damage output to make it hard to even Mei to freeze said heroes. It is especially bad when her only form of range is a projectile that is in fact the ONLY projectile subjected to fall off damage. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwC6QVpn8MkAfter the Ana issue with her becoming the new OP and Must-Pick, the developers have become wary of any incident like that happening again when releasing a new hero. As such, Sombra had the most underwhelming reveal and hasn't moved in popularity and winrate for her entire existence since. Not to mention the fact that she has - and still is - riddled with bugs that detriment her kit overall with so many ability delays and has a ridiculously large spread in her primary that can't compete with other DPS like Soldier or Tracer. Symmetra long ago had the unique mechanic of Photon Shield, which gave allies permanent shield health until the targeted ally died, this was toned down immensely since it meant heroes with 150hp at the time like Tracer, Genji, and Zenyatta were able to benefit from Sym overall. While Symmetra wasn't considered OP, she was a bi-product of a combo that was considered OP. It was at this point that they flat out changed it to an ultimate and filled the Ability slot for Photon Barrier, which not only has a niche usage, but can' really compare to the original strength of Photon Shield. Even then and now, you can't really consider Symmetra over any healer since they have better utility overall. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdirotiA9hshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7n-1sEoZHQUPosted by SilentStormThe Trifecta's design their downfallMei has a projectile fall off, intentionally making her horrible in far range where she lacks. Mei's Ice Wall intentionally is a troll ability by design since your team can't see through the wall which makes it a detriment to your team if they can't see what's going on. Comparing to Reaper, he has a CC immune ability that allows him to move for 3 seconds and is able to reload to have the upper hand; a Mei gets stuck in place, doesn't reload, and no protection to ward people from swarming your Cryofreeze. If they're not gonna add anything to it, they should at least decrease the cooldown. Sombra has a delay to go in and out of Stealth, incredibly weak threshold on her abilities, long as cooldown on Hack and Stealth to make her unable to actually be ready to use them, and a ridiculously large spread that makes her the worst in terms of reliable DPS. Not to mention the bug issue, you can't expect me to believe that Sombra is comparably reliable to a Soldier or Tracer. Symmetra's turret has a 1.4 casting time, 10 meter dmg range, 25% speed reduction that can stack, with a 10 second cooldown with each turret, all of which have 1 HP. First of all, no one finds it fun to have a turret nest at a choke or in a room, not the enemy, not even the Sym player as it is mind-numblingly boring to do so. Secondly, having all of your turrets nested around a choke hitting 1 person is easily 120 dps with a 150% speed reduction; IF all do hit without being destroyed, and that is a big IF, cause most tanks can easily take them out, and with the newly added Moira can easily destroy the nest without hassle with her Biotic Orb and Grasp. Thirdly, it takes 30 seconds to build 3 new turrets, that is the same cooldown as a Mercy Rez, I'm not here to believe that bringing back someone from the dead is as important as building 3 1HP turrets.Lastly, Torbjorn has a better utility with his singular turret since his have 150 instant health that can gain 150+ health and damage more with a constant range of 40 meters. And with her Photon Barrier, the shape of the shield only helps if you're moving forward in chokes, it doesn't protect you from the sides nor behind; it doesn't have a very strong purpose other than to protect quick ults or to protect yourself, but even then you have a ridiculously long cooldown of 10 seconds that supposed to move without any control; a lot can easily happen in under 10 seconds that would be hard to protect.To sum it up, I can't expect to believe something as unreliable as these abilities with a big cooldown would help my team and myself in any non-niche way.Developer Recognition and AcknowledgmentMei's megathread on page 69 got acknowledgement of the fact that the page is being monitored, but many can agree that waiting over 2 weeks for anything else than that is not enough. She also got acknowledgement from Reddit of a bug thread that they'll look into. https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759356748#post-1https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/7ko6mx/mei_bug_list_with_examples/While the Sombra megathread hasn't got an acknowledgement post, we at least got a post from the bug megathread (one that I and many others have helped with) with it only acknowledging what has been categorized as ""fixed"" and the open response of hearing all the issues that aren't actually fixed. 2 weeks later and we've pretty much disproved the fact that the bugs have gone away, they still riddle Sombra and we still wait for any response or acknowledgement. https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760826184?page=1https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759587944?page=1https://youtu.be/soqdrpbbS-Q?t=2m17sThe outlier here is that Symmetra's megathread that has over 200 pages with no recognition whatsoever with any blue post. None. Many people - including myself - suggesting ideas and concepts on how to fix her without Sym becoming OP, but even still, I've seen a Lucio thread that asked for his ult to be buffed with a blue post saying that he's fine the way he is; my question is where is that response for Symmetra? https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759380928?page=1https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759517867#post-14To sum it up simplyWe need a better response for all of us so we can know if our fight for our mains is worth fighting for. It's tiring to believe from the lack of responses that with over 310 pages in total have been been all for naught because none of this will be even be shown in the PTR, we don't know and it's frustrating. You have to show that you're not scared of us seeing change or improvement of our heroes without making them ""OP"" or ""must-pick"", just something..."

These three heroes are in fact THE only heroes that haven't had a prominent change for basically their entire existence, always at the bottom of the barrel in comp picks. These heroes at their current state won't be taken seriously and would STILL be picked in comp for 2 reasons: to be taken seriously with the hero and use them in their proper niche, OR to use them purposely in poor situations to use as a throw pick. You say for everyone to play actually good heroes, why can't the Trifecta be good heroes too?"

There's going to be ten times as many &lt;insert viable hero here&gt; mains being top500 as well, because some heroes are stronger/more efficient than others.If you want a comparison, there is going to be a martial artist somewhere who can kick your and my butt at the same time, with a hand behind his back.

I've won several games lately by leaving one person on the payload while the rest of the team attacks the flankers.

Game requires bunny hoping.",NA,"Sorry to tell you but all of you are wrong and it's OP's mistake due to poor reasoning and writing. I'll explain you what's going on with this matter, why it is stupid to be implemented and what it is in first place.Bunny hop has nothing to do with a mere spam space. It was essentially a glitch in counter strike where the character's velocity was increasing if you were strafe jumping in certain patterns. Strafe jumping can be observed with soldier, while sprinting and lucio. However, if you were pressing space again in a specific momentum, your character wasn't losing his velocity, which had as a result to increase continuously your speed. As the speed increases, it becomes more difficult to control your momentum in both strafes and jumps, so eventually you fail. That was bunny hop.It was forbidden to be used in tournaments for long time, since it messed around with the engagement timings. In short there was a high distortion in time (you didn't know when an enemy 1 mile away will eventually come to you). After many years, they decided to allow bunny hopping as it became a common practice in unofficial games and tournaments, but they forbidden the use of mouse scroll as jump.Except acceleration and time distortion, there was another use of bunny hop. They used to bunny hop to entry and become more difficult targets to snipers. However, there's a huge difference here. In Counter Strike there was different dmg if you hit an arm, a leg or body. Snipers there have only 1 bullet at the time, and they one shot body and head, while you will not be killed if you are hit on the leg. This does not occur in Overwatch. Furthermore, overwatch heroes can aim while in the air, while counter strike characters are penalized. Therefore, bunnyhopping there, gives you high mobility with the drawback of not being able to hit.It's not easy to hit someone who bunny hops properly, even for a master... However who cares about ""hitting properly"" in overwatch? Just smash his legs and he takes the same dmg. Also, there's no such a thing as predictable bunnyhopping because velocity increases, but not linearly. It depends on the strafe at the given jump."

So I compiled a list of little tips that I have found to be valuable and that I have learned in my time playing Mei so far and I wanted to share my knowledge! Now I know Mei could use some QOL changes and a few tweaks here or there but, regardless of that, I really enjoy her and always have! So here goes nothing. I hope you guys enjoy and make use of these!Mei Tips:-You can freeze somebody in a couple seconds with primary fire. The stream from Mei's gun is actually more of consecutive ""puffs,"" if you will, (Like tiny clouds) than an actual stream of fire. The best policy for a quick freeze is to aim, as closely as possible to an enemy and where the enemy WILL BE as oppose to where they currently are. Because Mei's weapon is not hitscan, this results in a more reliable freeze. This helps, particularly, with denying mobile heroes.-On that same note, it is best to attempt a freeze on heroes after they have used their escapes. I.E. A Genji who has just dashed into your back line, a tracer who is absent-mindedly blinking and recalling, a Sombra who has just trans-located, a Moira who has just phased, etc.-Mei's freeze is a great tool for not only securing kills but interrupting enemies. Flank and bum-rush heroes mid-ult to be extra annoying.Most of the time a McRee or a Road Hog are ulting, they are focusing on getting kills; not you. This can result in a reliable stop to many ults and sometimes a kill. Heck, it can even be useful to interrupt healing!-Zarya can bubble frozen heroes to cleanse a freeze. You can also activate her personal bubble as she is about to freeze to cleanse the slow and deny an impending freeze.-If you listen closely to the sound being broadcast as somebody comes close to freezing, you can actually time RMB just right and hit enemies right as they freeze. This can result in you being able to land up to a triple headshot on heroes. Combined with a punch, at the end, this can kill even some Tanks.-You can use Mei's Ice Block as cover - similar to her wall. (You can also Iceblock on top of frozen enemies and create extra cover for allies) I have jumped in front of a D.Va bomb and saved allies many times (Or so it appears).-Mei's iceblock can also be canceled early. This can help take enemies off-guard or helps you to avoid being trapped and mined by a Junkrat (Junk Mine can 1-shot Mei due to her hitbox)-Mei Iceblock now cleanses Ana grenade (This was a 2+ year-long bug)-Mei wall can be put under your feet or allied hero's feet to break Junkrat traps instantly (It can also be used on enemies postmortem for hilarious body launches).-Similarly, you can actually place a Mei wall under your own feet and jump right as it peaks to avoid being hurt by a Doomfist ult; when timed properly it completely avoids it.-Another fun thing is to place a wall between you and the enemy team as soon as a Zarya ult lands (Remember, you can drop your wall whenever you feel like it). You can also wall-off Mcree ults this way. This can really take people off-guard or even lure enemies into a false sense of security only to have your wall dropped and them ulted.-Use her wall to sneak around choke points guarded by Torb turrets or Bastions. Each pillar can eat 500 or so damage before breaking.-Mei wall eats Moira orbs and can completely ruin her planned trajectory for them.-You can also use Mei's wall to trap enemies in allied hero ults such as Road Hog or Pharah or Secure a Doomfist punch kill.-When dueling a Doomfist, as Mei, you can win every time. Just wait for him to let out a rocket punch and block it with an ability, do the same as he tries to spam abilities and, with proper tracking, you'll freeze and icicle his face in no time (Just try to avoid dueling close to walls).-Similarly, you can block Rein charges.-Mei wall shines when it is used to split enemy teams and secure kills. It can, however, also be used defensively to negate nasty ults like a D.Va bomb. You can use it to wall yourself into corners, indoors, to save yourself from Winstons, Genjis, and other ults too. I recommend blocking Moira ult, Road Hog Ult, and D.Va Ult with it. You can even block some junkrat ults with good timing.-Use Mei wall to sneak up into high positions and freeze enemy snipers. Note that they will be the bane of your existence in-game but, even some experienced snipers suffer from tunnel vision and will fall victim to a freeze and the following abrupt icicle lobotomy; without proper attention.-Fun Fact: You can use Mei Wall, when placed under your feet and far enough onto the corner, on the second point of Hanamura to sneak in the back way. Just jump as you reach the edge of your wall and you will make it!-Mei's RMB can 1-shot a Tracer if you can plant one in her noggin. It is also one of the fastest ways to charge your ult. Be sure to try and land headshots on Tanks like D.VA &amp; Road Hog. They can basically be your personal ult battery.-Fun Fact: Mei's ult requires a little longer to charge than your average ult.-Use Mei icicles in your downtime to poke and charge your ult and to harass Pharahs. Even though it has fall-off damage, the poke you provide can help secure kills and ward off pesky attackers/flankers - even if you aren't getting head shots. Remember, Mei's icicle also has a slight arc at longer ranges. An experienced Mei can out-duel other long-range heroes at mid-range. Just time the RMB fire delay right!-Be sure to flank unsuspecting Reinhardts (Especially if you can catch them alone). You can shoot a freeze ray up their butts and stun them - effectively locking them out of their barrier and potentially exposing the enemy team or securing a kill. It should also be noted that you can literally run circles around some Reins and use your primary fire to freeze them even if they are trying to block you.-During Mei ult, you can freeze somebody with primary fire in less than a second (with good aim). Use this on heroes you know can escape (Which is most of them). You can also lightly touch heroes with your primary and they will freeze in the order you specify. As far as I know, as long as they are in your ult, they will stay frozen. For this reason, Mei Ult never actually NEEDS to be paired with any other ult. Just mop up some free Popsicle kills.-FUN FACT: Roughly 25 of the heroes have a very high chance of escaping your ult if they are paying attention.-In regards to her ult, the best policy is to throw it when you are unseen. You can throw it straight up to delay its activation or you can simply throw it behind the enemy team, when pushing, and they will back into it. Alternatively, use your wall to close the enemy team's escape. No need to be shy, get in there and start shooting some icicles!-Mei's ult can be canceled by D.Va Matrix or even deflected by a skilled Genji; before it lands. Keep this in mind as a deflected Mei ult can wind up securing your enemy a team kill.-Mei ult also freezes enemies slightly above or below it.-Mei shines on payload maps. Her little body can actually effectively hide behind almost every single payload; when she crouches. This protects you from 90+% of enemy fire and snipers and forces them to run up to the payload to get you off of it. This puts them right in freezing range. Wall them off, freeze them, and secure a kill on your over-extended and unprotected new friend.-Mei is a-mei-zing at staling points and payloads. Many Meins don't like the fact that this is part of her character but, it serves teams well often enough. Use your wall and iceblock to be pesky and stall points until your team arrives. This is exceptionally helpful during overtime.-Mei can function as an off-tank when played well.-As Mei, Snipers, discord orbs, and Pharah's will prove tough to handle. Use LOS well and practice countering people. Discord orb falls off after 3 seconds out of Zen's LOS (So does Harmony). #Itgetsbetter.-Lastly, Mcree will be your arch nemesis. Bait out his flash bang, in close range, and Iceblock or wall to negate it. After that, dance around and freeze him. If he doesn't headshot you at least twice, you will probably win the duel. Don't forget: There is a slight delay between iceblock and wall activation that lets bullets and effects through. This can result in a canceled Iceblock and death or getting headshot through your wall. Time it appropriately.Have fun my little Ice Queens!"

The problem is that there could be a Year of the Dog icon next holiday patch that takes the place of the Red Envelope. But it won't be called 'Year of the Dog Icon 2017'. It will be called 'Gingerbread Cake' or something with barely visible Year of the Dog icing on it, and no obvious sign that it will be permanently removed after the event. Blizzard assumes people know these random icons will be unavailable without specifying, but that's just vague and unfun to guess around. It's especially frustrating because Blizzard repeatedly points out that the holiday items come back every year, but we aren't told which items never return until they are already gone.

I agree with blizzard with perma-locking YEAR specific things, for example, the event player icons, the competitive icons, etc.At least veteran players would have something to brag aboutThis topic is about suggestions for Blizzard to fix their poor job of letting people know which yearly items will be removed permanently from the game. Bragging is neither here nor there. I've always been fine with permanently missable collectors items; it's Blizzard's approach that I find strange this time around. Blizzard likes to showcase how transparent they are with their community, and they usually are, but removing items from loot boxes without so much as mentioning it in the patch notes I find meaner than the usual Blizzard status quo.Plus the removed player icons in question were implemented before the Lootbox recoding earlier this year. One could have played every day of Winter Wonderland and Chinese New Year and never got either icon. There's nothing wrong with tough luck. But it would be nice, like Scynt suggested, if Blizzard let us know exactly which items will leave us in the future if we don't impulse buy more loot boxes."

With competitive rewards Blizzard did a great job specifying, before the mode was even added, that Competitive Player Icons and sprays would always be limited time, forever missable items. They are consistent and self explanatory. It's hard to confuse that an icon or spray aptly named 'Season 5 Contender' will ever be available again. A simple icon named Red Envelope, though? Or one named 2017? No indication in their names, images, or tooltip that they will be removed from next year's loot boxes. Prior to clicking this thread, I'm sure very few people even considered that the Red Envelope icon was already removed. But it probably is. That shows how inconsistent these removed icons are in comparison to the competitive rewards."

Junkrat wasn't just ""trash tier"" prior to him hurting himself, he was a legitimate liability and anyone with 400+ hp could just walk up to him and stand on top of him to make him die instantly.  Blizzard changed it 12 months ago because it was an awful design.  This was also back in the day when Winston had less mobility and a long barrier cd, and we didn't have Orisa who now could just fire a shield in front of JR and laugh as he dies instantly.  OP is a Widow/Handsoap main (he also plays Gengu and Tracer, which explains the JR hate).  Both are incredibly strong counters to JR and should be getting to places he can't spam-choke.  Stop being bad, and stop trying to 1v1 JR in a confined space.

If it weren't for the seasonal skins, I probably would have stop playing quite a bit ago."
"941","https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760706907","Is Overwatch still fun ?",NA,"A lot of people get pretty biased with this game, but in my opinion, the strength of this game is what you make of it. If you expect the game to do all of the work, then you might get bored. Overwatch gives you things to play with, you just have to use what is given. If playing the same hero for too long gets tiring, try someone else. If soloqueue sucks, try to put together a team of people you like. I've done both one-tricking in soloqueue and trying random heros in a group, and they both have their perks, but soloqueue is just not as replayable for me."

I'm spending more time in comp understanding where i'm not contributing the most as a support so i can figure out how to do it a little better. Lots of videos and threads from pros and streamers alike to figure out what i've been doing wrong. SR is up 300+ over last season, my hero pool is more diverse, and i'm getting better at adapting, despite big changes. Legit having more fun than i ever have."

Overwatch is a blast and there is always something new for me to learn, or improve on. I may not enjoy competitive all that much, but I do love quickplay, a lot of the arcade modes, and I can get down with the custom made games as well. Right now I'm improving my headshot powaz! In them custom games that are headshot only Widow battles. It's a bit stressful because I know if I can't land them headshots Blizzards gonna kick me for being inactive xD"

Overwatch has never been improved a single time since launch unless ""LMAO MINI GAMEZ AND COSTUMEZ XD"" is your idea of what 100% of development needed to be pumped into while half the cast is in languish.Overwatch is like... Smash Bros, only not as good and hilariously with worse balance despite typical Blizzard intrusive patching."

I wish they would keep the current comp as it is, more or less, just for the CP for gold weapons. Then there wouldn't be a loss of SR to make losing so terrible and off-putting and I could enjoy all the cool moments again.Just make a new version of comp that requires 6-stacks, receives the ranking icons and sprays, and CP as well. It just makes sense to have three modes."
