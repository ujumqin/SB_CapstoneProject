"4","DID YOU SEE THE HERO GALLERY THOUGH.""MARK ALL SEEN""Best. Addition."
"5","screenshot or it didn't happen"
"6","Ctrl+F ""Doomfist"" = 1/1 result (Ooooo)Fixed a bug that caused Doomfist’s Seismic Slam to create performance drops when repeatedly used with no cooldown.Some day buddy....some day"
"7","Mission failed, we'll get em next time."
"8","To be fair hitboxes aren't listed in the patch notes, can someone confirm his hitboxes haven't changed?"
"9","Same, size of Mercy pistol shot hitbox."
"10","FeelsBadMan"
"11","And it feels like this was there for last 4 PTR releases, ever since Junkertown - you get placed into games all over the world, 200-300 ping. EU, US, Korea."
"12","I don't experience that.However that's most likely just because not many people even bother with the PTR."
"13","There is only one PTR server and it is U.S.-based."
"14","You don't know what you're talking about."
"15","Ah, so they've been buffed!"
"16","Dang. No fixes for Moria's orbs when deflected by Genji or Moria targeting Torb turrets. Eyelashes falling off is hilarious though. "
"17","No fixes for Moria's orbs when deflected by Genji or Moria targeting Torb turrets.Genji is supposed to be able to deflect them. Also the only other lock-on beam in the game (Symmetra's) also targets Torb's turret."
"18","Sorry i wasn't clear, I should have been more spefic. When Genji defects Moria orbs they loose their damage/healing cap of 200/300. Allowing Genji to get much more use out of them. Moria also isn't able to target Torb turrets since she was on the PTR. "
"19","Holy shit that's crazy. "
"20","Well damn. Sorry."
"21","no need to be sorry, I wasn't clear. "
"22","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUUuudcA9aM&amp;feature=youtu.be"
"23","Hey look it's the guy that assumes he knows what he's talking about when he doesn'tWhen Genji deflects an orb, the deflected orb can heal/damage infinitely for its duration. They're supposed to stop at 300 healing or 200 damage.Moira's problem is that her beam doesn't lock on to Torb turrets. Also they actually did fix this on PTR, it just isn't listed (because who needs comprehensive patch notes)."
"24","The Torb issue is fixed in the PTR but not the orbs? That's half good news. No need to blow up on that guy though. My initial message assumed the issues were common enough knowledge. "
"25","I was wrong, doesn't mean you need to be an ass about it."
"26","Blizzard World aaaaaww yiiissss, didn't expect it this early"
"27","They didn't mention the Moira nerf."
"28","It's likely an unintended bug."
"29","Oh man new map just came out? cant wait."
"30","I’m so happy that not being able to go through people during fade was a bug!"
"31","Does this mean the new Blizzcon skins are in the game, perchance? "
"32","No, those skins (and a lot more cosmetics, those were only a sampling) are coming early 2018."
"33","Ah, bummer. Thanks for responding!"
"34","No prob! :D"
"35","usually they don't release skins on the ptr so no need to check up on that :)"
"36","i probably should have known that...sexy blonde rein clouded my judgment :D"
"37","Still no Zenyatta's healing orb HUD indicator :("
"38","Fixed a bug where Mei couldn't heal if she was anti healed"
"39","Fixed a bug that prevented Mei’s Cryo-freeze from clearing the healing debuff caused by Ana’s Biotic GrenadeWait what? Mei cryo is supposed to clear ana healing debuff? That doesnt seem very fair. "
"40","HAHAHAHA IT'S BEEN NEARLY 1.5 FREAKING YEARS AND ITS SAT IN THE BUG LIST THE ENTIRE TIME. MEI'S CRYO-FREEZE IS SUPPOSED TO CLEAR DEBUFFS ANA!I've never been salty about it or anything though.Not the buff Mei deserves, but god damn I'll take anything."
"41","That's actually pretty big for Mei"
"42","It is, but only against one of 26 heroes.Though as a healer Ana does get more use than most."
"43","Zarya's bubble clears the debuff as well doesn't it? It makes sense that cryo would clear it as well"
"44","It doesnt clear it, but you cant nade her if she's bubbled I think"
"45","it clears both nade and discord"
"46","This is the correct answer."
"47","It's been listed as a known bug for over a year now. It just took ages for them to get around to fixing it."
"48","Yeah it hink that's a pretty stupid idea..."
"49","Nah, It's supposed to make you invincible (think wraith form) so I think the debuff should disappear. "
"50","In a slight way, I think this makes Mei way more viable as a delay character, and if there's anything we learned about the South Korea vs USA matchup, it's that you can be very effective if you coordinate your delays on CP.I think we'll see this become a huge thing in OWL too.I don't personally like it, while I do think Mei deserves buffs, I hope they explore reducing her ice block time (even if it just heals her up faster). "
"51","But the point of the grenade is to deny heals. I think it should still be able to do that."
"52","It does do that. It just does it properly now."
"53","She's still invincible tho! She just didn't get the heal.I would agree Mei needs a buff, but not at expensive of Ana who has the worst winrate in the game."
"54","It is consistent with Reaper, who can get healed via external sources through wraith form after clearing the debuff, so clearing the debuff when going invincible is meant to be a thing."
"55","Ana who has the worst winrate in the game.Source?"
"56","use any website you want my guy. Overbuff, master overwatch etc."
"57","Overbuff does record Ana has having the lowest winrate in comp, but it also lists her as having a substantially higher pickrate than the next 6 heroes on the list, which heavily skews the data.MasterOverwatch actually reports Hanzo as having the lowest winrate, with Ana in second. But again, her pickrate is much higher than her peers around her.I also don't think either of these stats really matters though, because both list Symmetra and Torbjorn as having the highest winrates, even though both of them are commonly said to be in the ranks of the worst heroes in the game.Not to mention, Ana just got a huge buff which could see her being used more often and to much greater effect, especially since Mercy was nerfed. But these haven't had the time to have a great effect since it's only been 4 days since the patch.Clearly winrate isn't a great metric to use in discussions like this. "
"58","Ana had the worst winrate thanks to Mercy being OP as fuck. Now that things have changed she'll go back up.Unless you're referring to console, in which case good luck."
"59","Rip Doomfist"
"60","Are the Blizzard World skins in this patch as well?"
"61","Skins are never released in the ptr. But they made it clear that they (and some other unannounced skins) would be released early 2018 together with blizzworld"
"62","Is moira now playable in comp?"
"63","That'll be next week, not a PTR patch. This patch probably won't release until Blizzard World next year."
"64","Damn so she’s unavailable in comp for 2 weeks now? That blows. I wish blizz would’ve said something "
"65","It's like they want to leave doomfist broken..."
"66","He wants to break the world, but instead broke himself."
"67","Ironic."
"68","He could break himself, but not others"
"69","Where did you got it?EDIT: nvm i see it"
"70","Mei fix is dumb. That should've been left as is."
"71","Cool. Not cool enough."
