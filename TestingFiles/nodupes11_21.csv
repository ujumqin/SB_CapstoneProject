(my personal big issue with this)*Possible solution to this-pause respawn timer/prevent it from going out while Mercy is resurrecting target player-reset Mercy's resurrect if target player respawns before resurrect takes effect2) The non-reset to GA when ulting is dandy. No problems have been had (by me at least.)3) The Movement speed reduction seems sorta harsh, and if the patch notes truly didn't mention it then that's a problem, but my experience with it as of this time is neutral."

The Mercy players obviously don't like this nerf and if you make ressurect too easy to cast and Mercy is in every match again you will have alienated everyone who isn't a Mercy player.It's okay to backtrack sometimes and a complete revert isn't needed but Ressurect has no place in this game as a regular ability."

But that won't stop me from giving it.The cast time is a welcome addition that helps give diversity to Mercys kit, making resurrect feel powerful in ultimate. The slowdown is counter intuitive to her mobility and her new core identity as a highly mobile hero with heavy constant healing.I say either lock Mercy to the ressurected target while she is casting so that she can still feel somewhat mobile and have a chance to dodge aroundOr remove resurrect as an E, up the charges in valkryie, and give us an upward mobility ability on E that could be replaced when she uses Valkryie.No character who's core identity is ""high mobility"" should be subjected to such a harsh slowdown.

I am a Mercy main with approaching 300 hours on the hero. While I appreciate that a nerf needed to happen.. the movement speed and cast time nerf for the res is something that has completely ruined the character for me.The fact that a mercy has always been a target in games was fine with me, it gave dps a person to focus from the enemy side. The recent nerf to her res has made her such an easy target that whenever you go for a res you are most likely going to die for it. I personally never saw the point in the initial nerf as I was never a hide then res mercy but I can see the point from the broader populous of mercy players. With this nerf I really cannot emphasis enough how much it has put me off the game. While I can and do play other heroes my favourite was mercy. The constant nerfs are causing me to stop playing. Which is a shame as I have played a lot of the game and put money into loot boxes etc. I can no longer sit quietly while my favourite hero is destroyed."

Now, before anyone says ""Bunny just want OP Mercy!"", hear me out. What I like is that you initiate your ult and then, because of the lowered cooldowns, you fly in and rez people similar to how she worked right after the rework, only instead of the 10 second cooldown it's 5 seconds. Now, I believe on total mayhem Mercy can rez as many as 5 people during her ult, and that is too many for live obviously. But still, the mode gave me a feeling for how it would feel if she had 3 charges with little to no cooldowns, and it feels great! You feel like you make a difference, that you can clutch and save a bad situation. And rezzing feels good in Valkyrie. What I'm trying to say is that this has strengthen my belief that Valkyrie can be fun, it just needs that extra rez charge, and I think if we gave up the ability outside of ult a lot of people would agree that it's a fair trade. Heck, I would also give up 5 seconds of Valkyrie for this! I wonder if it's possible to set up a custom game that works like this..."

A hectic mode like that you cant be sitting around for nearly 2s trying to get res off, you'll get blasted in the face or at least one punched by Doomfist and then res is put on cooldown and your killed immediately after.While that mode has nothing big to do with the topic overall it was just something I needed to vetn. Still she needed a nerf but at the expense of her fun factor? She was nerfed to the point that EVERY hero in the game counters her now not just a few flankers and really skilled players that can pick her off. Nope horrible players and pros alike and with any hero no less.I mean she's just standing there.

CONS: Said that, her gameplay now feels really unsatisfying and underpowered when you consider that she was suposed to be a fast mobility hero but gets a high mobility penalty on an redesign ability that was fun and strong if coordinated and that made her gameplay more agressive and ...well.. better because she has a new skill ir her rotation. Possible fixes: Make the mobility penalty lower or non-existent (so we can at least try to evade enemy fire). Redesign the E skill to something new (although i love the rez and suits her) . Cut off the cast time but make the cd higher. Or expande the reach of the rez (so we can try to get some cover).Mercy 1.0: It was great to mass rez, but most times i felt like hiding more than usual waiting the other team's ults to use mine. Now i have a new skill to make gameplay more versatile along with an ult that does the same, and both making me play more agressive than just hiding from the other team.Sorry for any bad part.

It's an over-reliable tool in a kit and can completely destroy comps. The fact he has 2, huge bombs that do around 120 HP (depending on armor) is insane. That basically guarantees kills just by pressing shift and right click in the general area of the reticle, and then those mines come back insanely quickly,  like you never even lost them . I have 2 suggestions. Either the mine gets a nerf to be at a damage value of 90, giving Junkrat capability to still give a one-shot combo with a grenade and a mine, but making it less BS. The second is that the radius of the explosion is decreased by 20% making it harder to land, and sparing groups of players  to Junkrat's mine all at once.

Though if this is the real reason then I think it's a bs reason. By doing this you're being useless and you can achieve the same result by looking at a wall.Anyway I'd honestly settle for at least being able to walk slowly (at crouch speed) to mask our footsteps. I don't think it's fair that every character gets to sneak around except D.Va.This.Basically you'd be free of critical hits crouching and looking down. She used to be able to crouch before this was found out. I think they just removed her ability to crouch because no other character holds this ""ability.""Agreed, though, I think sneaking ability should be allowed."

If anything it's a QoL. I mean if you're gonna crouch+look down to face tank an attack it'll also mean a) you cant see anything aside from the floor and b) you can't attack. It'll help with facetanking for squishies when DM is down, but otherwise doesn't really change anything.What do you guys think?"

We wanted to give you a heads up on what’s happening with the targeting on Moira’s Biotic Grasp.On the PTR, we made a number of improvements to the mechanism that Moira uses to select a target. Now players can more accurately select a target when multiple targets are in the field of view (which resolves issues like this: https://streamable.com/rosvo), and the new system can better discern which target is closest to the player's reticle when multiple targets are valid.  When we made this change, we did our best to make the everything feel as close to her original system as possible, but since the new mechanism uses a different functionality, it didn’t convert perfectly for a number of heroes. Generally, the larger heroes are a little harder to target, while the smaller heroes are much closer to her original behavior. The training bots also need to be adjusted, as they are by far the worst offender in the new system. Since it wasn't our intention to do anything but improve Moira's targeting, we’re hoping to test a new configuration on the PTR either late this week or early next. Thank you so much for surfacing the issue for us; these reports are incredibly useful for us when it comes to tracking down bugs.Hopefully this gets sorted out correctly."

Nothing was said regarding it afterwards, no clarification of whether it was a bug or not that the hitbox became smaller than Mercy's bullets.That said, I'm very happy to hear they're trying to fix her targeting. I had a few situations where a low health target was stunned but I couldn't lock onto them because of another target a little closer and off to the side eating my biotic grasp.

Imagine the following situation,Your in turret mode, shooting at an X target, In which, you see your hp deplete quickly from a reaper that is coming your way, So, In order to survive you Press E, to summon your barrier to protect you as you hold right click to heal the 200 you lost from reapers sneak attack, Reaper wasted all his shots on your barrier and so he now needs to reload, And this is your oportunity to strike and barrage him with your large minigun.Anyways This is just an idea i had from my own experience playing bastion"

He has a high target value. Because of that, an opposing team's effort is largely spent on taking him down so that they can keep an area from being dominated by that Bastion. His team should know this. Bastion is one of the most team-reliant characters in the game, if not the most reliant, and not having his own personal barrier adds to the need for team cooperation."

Sentry mode is Bastion's primary purpose. It's only natural that you would die as the least-mobile character who chooses to also negate his damage output.Further, why are you trying to 1v1 in the first place? Do you not have tanks or a sense of grouping up?(I'm asking in agitation; I push for teamwork and grouping and all that stuff all the time, but for whatever reason, I'm often stuck in lower ranks than people with no game sense.

Bastion does 20 damage per bullet and fires 8 times per second in recon mode, with a full auto spread comparable to 76's burst fire.Like, I can get behind ""I need to work on my tracking because these heroes give me trouble"" or ""I got surprised by a super good Tracer in quick play"", but to say that you just can't 1v1 those heroes  at all with a literal laser beam of death at your disposal is a little disingenuous.Also, Pharah is absolutely not a threat to recon Bastion for similar skill levels.  If she's far away he can dodge her rockets, and if she's up close she's going to be taking 160 DPS and can't two-shot him anyway.  Bastion's falloff starts at 35 meters, and a Pharah that is further away than that is basically not contributing to the fight with her insanely slow rockets.Also... also, Bastion's current design, as intended by Blizzard, is that you spend most of your time in recon mode, and surprise people with sentry mode to the face when you have an opportunity to switch.  Everything in his rework is aimed at making this viable, and outside his low-ish tankiness for his size, they did a pretty good job."

Around 80-120 would be more accurate.And a Bastion who isn't in Sentry mode is a worse Soldier 76, so her keeping him out of Sentry is like having him hacked at all times because he isn't using an ability that is necessary to his effectiveness.11/21/2017 04:08 PMPosted by hensoldtAlso... also, Bastion's current design, as intended by Blizzard, is that you spend most of your time in recon mode, and surprise people with sentry mode to the face when you have an opportunity to switch.

Come on, lets get real.No, he's not picked because he's Fat:76.  He's huge, slow, lacks burst damage, and has no real ability to project threat independently due to his defining feature requiring an entire team comp built around him.He's a niche hero, and when you pick him for the right moment he's very effective.  Claiming he's bad (specifically) because he can't 1v1 Tracer or Genji is nonsense, though--he can, but why would you pick Bastion over 76 except in very specific situations?"

It's time we answer the call!!","1511330460","11/21/2017 04:42 AMPosted by GoatyMcGoathttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvqlmGK5bSY10 minutes in so far. Pros: You recycle your Orisa shield very well, this is good, you are providing continual protection for your team.Your positioning is good defensively for both pointsCons: You could get a lot more out of Orisa if you aim for the head. Her headshots are where she really shines. Piggy backing off the headshots, a great tactic is to use the orb then aim where the person you pull is going to end up after pulled and spam that location for good hits. Also aiming the orb higher allows for more shots and holds the enemy slightly longer because now they have to fall further. You may think this is a small thing, but it can mean the difference between a kill or an enemy getting away.Watch your flank and watch to see if your team is relocating their position, there were a few times when flankers were making their move to the right or left, and your team wanted to engage them. Follow them in and give them your shield. Once you mop up, then place your shield in it's normal defensive position for the next attack.There was one time when the enemy mei blocked your vision on the second point. If you see this, chances are they are trying to hide their flank, and sure enough, the enemy team went right and it caught you off guard.Lastly, and this point is very important: You need to tab key (not sure what button this is for the consoles). You need to see the enemy hero composition to know if you should switch to a better tank for the situation. Not only this, tabbing will also allow you to see your teams ultimates to know if you can combo, or that you may need to drop your ult if it's the only one ready for the next enemy attack.This last point is the best advice I can give you to improving your game. While on attack:Cons:starting with cons because I notice them right away. You are straddling the choke. You don't want to do this. You need to be pushing up with your team. Symmetra is holding down the left, so right side is a good choice. The enemy Orisa and Bastion are on the high ground (they have better positioning) your best bet is to have the lucio speed boost your team to the right and claim the higher ground to then attack the point. You spend minutes fighting a symmetra you can't kill on the right. Not good, your shield gets demolished in seconds vs the enemy bastion. Again, there is no point in straddling the choke. You are just watching your squishes die at the choke, instead of taking space (like a tank should do) to help your dps move into better positions to secure kills.@13:13 you finally push in, but this should have been done immediately, or with several attempts till your team breaks through.@14:50 you placed your shield on the choke, instead of placing it further up to help your 76 engage the enemy. Remember, again, tanks take space to help their team push in or secure kills. Place your shield further up to provide your team better protection, all your squishes are out in front of your shield, and that's not their fault, you have to have better shield placement on attack.@15:00 again, your put your shield on the bridge choking your group, instead of throwing it on the point to start to take space and engage the point with your team. This resulted in 2 squishes getting killed because they wanted to push onto the point, but your shield was further back.@15:40 you straddle the choke again. @16:04 two teammates are dead and you pop your ult. Not the best time to do it. Also your team is divided, would be better if they were all grouped up. You are the shield tank, your team is best when rallying with you. @16:40 I'm noticing you don't notice when your team is being flanked/killed via the kill feed in the top right. Tunnel vision can be a very bad thing in this game. Looking at the enemy team comp @18:03 Orisa may not be the best choice. The enemy reaper is building ult fast from kills. Her shield is becoming more useless against junkrat spam and Bastion. I personally would switch to D.Va at this point to attempt to stop a reaper ult, have the ability to fly away with d.va in case of rip tire, and DM bastion for pushing power. Not only that, your teammate went winston, not a very good pick in this situation, a Zarya would be better, but you could at least dive with Winston with D.Va. Also, you already have a lucio to help quickly push in.@18:26 NO! Your team got 3 picks and your shield placement was NOT on the point! You need better shield placement on attack with Orisa. You placed your shield and then ran past it, providing no protection to anyone. @20:25 You placed your shield behind your team. Not good. If you see your team push up, follow them. You must react to your team with your shield placement, don't rely on them to react to you. If you would have pushed up with your team, you would have avoided the flanking pharah.

It's time we answer the call!!","1511330460","11/21/2017 02:01 PMPosted by RichC11/21/2017 04:42 AMPosted by GoatyMcGoathttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvqlmGK5bSY10 minutes in so far. Pros: You recycle your Orisa shield very well, this is good, you are providing continual protection for your team.Your positioning is good defensively for both pointsCons: You could get a lot more out of Orisa if you aim for the head. Her headshots are where she really shines. Piggy backing off the headshots, a great tactic is to use the orb then aim where the person you pull is going to end up after pulled and spam that location for good hits. Also aiming the orb higher allows for more shots and holds the enemy slightly longer because now they have to fall further. You may think this is a small thing, but it can mean the difference between a kill or an enemy getting away.Watch your flank and watch to see if your team is relocating their position, there were a few times when flankers were making their move to the right or left, and your team wanted to engage them. Follow them in and give them your shield. Once you mop up, then place your shield in it's normal defensive position for the next attack.There was one time when the enemy mei blocked your vision on the second point. If you see this, chances are they are trying to hide their flank, and sure enough, the enemy team went right and it caught you off guard.Lastly, and this point is very important: You need to tab key (not sure what button this is for the consoles). You need to see the enemy hero composition to know if you should switch to a better tank for the situation. Not only this, tabbing will also allow you to see your teams ultimates to know if you can combo, or that you may need to drop your ult if it's the only one ready for the next enemy attack.This last point is the best advice I can give you to improving your game. While on attack:Cons:starting with cons because I notice them right away. You are straddling the choke. You don't want to do this. You need to be pushing up with your team. Symmetra is holding down the left, so right side is a good choice. The enemy Orisa and Bastion are on the high ground (they have better positioning) your best bet is to have the lucio speed boost your team to the right and claim the higher ground to then attack the point. You spend minutes fighting a symmetra you can't kill on the right. Not good, your shield gets demolished in seconds vs the enemy bastion. Again, there is no point in straddling the choke. You are just watching your squishes die at the choke, instead of taking space (like a tank should do) to help your dps move into better positions to secure kills.@13:13 you finally push in, but this should have been done immediately, or with several attempts till your team breaks through.@14:50 you placed your shield on the choke, instead of placing it further up to help your 76 engage the enemy. Remember, again, tanks take space to help their team push in or secure kills. Place your shield further up to provide your team better protection, all your squishes are out in front of your shield, and that's not their fault, you have to have better shield placement on attack.@15:00 again, your put your shield on the bridge choking your group, instead of throwing it on the point to start to take space and engage the point with your team. This resulted in 2 squishes getting killed because they wanted to push onto the point, but your shield was further back.@15:40 you straddle the choke again. @16:04 two teammates are dead and you pop your ult. Not the best time to do it. Also your team is divided, would be better if they were all grouped up. You are the shield tank, your team is best when rallying with you. @16:40 I'm noticing you don't notice when your team is being flanked/killed via the kill feed in the top right. Tunnel vision can be a very bad thing in this game. Looking at the enemy team comp @18:03 Orisa may not be the best choice. The enemy reaper is building ult fast from kills. Her shield is becoming more useless against junkrat spam and Bastion. I personally would switch to D.Va at this point to attempt to stop a reaper ult, have the ability to fly away with d.va in case of rip tire, and DM bastion for pushing power. Not only that, your teammate went winston, not a very good pick in this situation, a Zarya would be better, but you could at least dive with Winston with D.Va. Also, you already have a lucio to help quickly push in.@18:26 NO! Your team got 3 picks and your shield placement was NOT on the point! You need better shield placement on attack with Orisa. You placed your shield and then ran past it, providing no protection to anyone. @20:25 You placed your shield behind your team. Not good. If you see your team push up, follow them. You must react to your team with your shield placement, don't rely on them to react to you. If you would have pushed up with your team, you would have avoided the flanking pharah. Not sure if you noticed, but the reason why you got smashed that round was because the enemy team ran dive, and that counters Orisa hard. @24:00 you will notice on this attack, you are in the back, you aren't fully aware of your own teams position. This isn't good. You need to be leading the charge. You need more spacial awareness if you want to play Orisa on attack - and that includes being aware of your team, and when they decide to push.

Hope this helps.seriously this advice is extremely detailed and helpful thank you, i made a lot of mistakes but i am very glad it didnt cost my team the win, i did feel i used the shield for myself too much so at least i was seeing mistakes i was making but you gave a tonne of helpful advice and i appreciate it especially since i only really started using shield tanks recently.on some of the times you said i should have placed my shield further up i agree however at the time i was trying to gain some ground and then the next shield i shoot it up further to get to the point but thinking about it now my team were just going for the point instead of the gradual thing i was going for which wasnt too helpful of me but also the fact that the enemies were about to respawn so i wasnt really thinking right honestly i appreciate your feedback a lot because i know it will make me a much better Orisa, i am used to playing a less team based character(roadhog who is still team based but not nearly as much) so i need to lose my bad habits from that"

Personify him in the post. Or Zen would be another good one to imitate. Think of all the amazing things support players do for the betterment of their team. Think about how they work with all classes. For example: We will speed boost our bulky Rein's and Orisa's through the choke as Lucio, we will paint those targets purple for our diving dps with Zen, we will damage add our ulting McCree's with Mercy to help secure quicker kills. We will dance ontop of payloads with our tanks, we will risk being popped in the head by widow to rez our fallen brothers and sisters, we will bless or Diving Winston's and D.Va's with healing Orbs, we will harmony, damage stream, amp it up, and shower you all with Coalescence. We will break it down and transcend to counter ultimates! We are the support players of Overwatch! We keep you alive, keep you shooting, keep you diving, keep you standing, buy you as much time with heals so you can apply the killing pressure! We will never stop healing, never stop sleep-darting, never stop boosting, never stop rezing, Can't Stop! Won't Stop! Look at this team, we are gunna do great! Why? HEROES NEVER DIE! There is probably a ton more you can add into this, like ana's ult, symmetra's teleporter/shield gen, healing stream... you get it :)"

We wanted to give you a heads up on what’s happening with the targeting on Moira’s Biotic Grasp.On the PTR, we made a number of improvements to the mechanism that Moira uses to select a target. Now players can more accurately select a target when multiple targets are in the field of view (which resolves issues like this: [url=""https://streamable.com/rosvo""]https://streamable.com/rosvo[/url]), and the new system can better discern which target is closest to the player's reticle when multiple targets are valid.  When we made this change, we did our best to make the everything feel as close to her original system as possible, but since the new mechanism uses a different functionality, it didn’t convert perfectly for a number of heroes. Generally, the larger heroes are a little harder to target, while the smaller heroes are much closer to her original behavior. The training bots also need to be adjusted, as they are by far the worst offender in the new system. Since it wasn't our intention to do anything but improve Moira's targeting, we’re hoping to test a new configuration on the PTR either late this week or early next. Thank you so much for surfacing the issue for us; these reports are incredibly useful for us when it comes to tracking down bugs."

"465","https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759606352","QoL fixes for Mercy Rez","1511207160","There are a few things that still really bug me about this new rez and I think they need to be addressed asap.1) Other than looking at your killfeed, sometimes its hard to tell if your rez was successful. If you rez in the middle of a team fight, your main priority is to get the hell out of there as soon as the cast animation is over, It would be nice if there was some other feedback other than the killfeed2) When several teammates die together, say in a Grav for example, it would be really nice if the souls would not stack on top of each other. It would be nice if they spread out in a very small circle, small enough that Mercy can see each portrait easily. Since rez is single target now, it is more crucial than ever to make sure you are about the rez the right person.3) If you leave range of the soul while you are trying to rez, this will also trigger the 30 second cooldown. I think it is extremely important to show Mercy the exact range of each soul. For each soul, there should be a yellow circle around the soul to show the range in order to rez. (just like the green ring around Lucio, the souls should have the same yellow ring around them)Also I really think that if you are trying to rez and you get interrupted in any way, this should only trigger a 15 second cooldown and not the full 30 seconds. (I also think there should be no movement slow while trying to rez. I understand the cast time, I hate it, but I understand it, however the movement slow is not good and also feels really bad. Its actually ironic considering Mercy is supposed to be about healing/mobility and yet she has 1 ability that almost brings her mobility to a near stand still. There is no cohesion with that movement slow)"

"486","https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759556611","Can I Please Have Some Reinhardt Tips","1511341980","Hey, your the guy in the other Forum with the Reinhardt saving you! Well, here are a few tips and tricks in Quickplay and Competitive.1. When you want to move your team to the point fast and safely while having your shield up all the time, don't have the shield for a split second and jump forward. After that, hold your shield up for only a second to shield your team (and alert teammates to group up) and move. Continue to do this until your feet away from the point, so you can just walk with your shield. This method allows fast transportation while also having some quick protection.2. If your have your ultimate, use this pair to quickly kill the squishies. Ult, Fire strike, and charge. Not only will it devastate the enemy team, but you also get a achievement out of it.3. Only use your charge if its mandatory. For example, if there is a friendly Mercy in front of you and a Roadhog is going to hook her, charge in so she wont die, and give you heals. Always look for opportunities to help your teammates so your teammates can help you. However, if you are in the same situation but a Orisa is Roadhog, don't go for it or else you are only going to get stopped by a Orisa and get both of you killed.Bonus Tip: Charge only if the enemies back is near a wallAnd that's all the tips I have, hope this helps.Thanks!"
"487","https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759556611","Can I Please Have Some Reinhardt Tips","1511341980","1: Don't let your shield break. Leave it at ~50 health instead of letting it die. It can save some lives.2: Try baiting abilities/enemy shatter by putting your shield down for a second and pretending to swing. It can save you from a flashbang/scatter, sometimes even a Pulsebomb. 3: Be really careful with your charges. Only do it if you know it's not suicide. Try using it to clean up a teamfight you're winning, or to protect your teammate, usually a healer, when someone's diving them.4: Don't be afraid to use your hammer. It does 75 damage per swing. 2 swings at the enemy DPS can give your team a huge advantage, and it grants you a lot of ult charge.5: Don't go alone. Your shield will fall faster than Hanzo main's SR if you try to go 1v4-6.You need your team behind it.6: Try mastering your predictions so that you can use Firestrike consistently.7: Don't be afraid to shatter. Getting a huge one is great, but killing 2 people is usually enough to swing the battle to your side. You'll build another one really quickly anyway.8: Don't be passive/defensive when pushing a choke. Walk forwards with your shield up if your team is with you. Make space for the DPS. Standing and waiting for a miracle won't really help much.9: Know how to position yourself, so you can shield your teammate when he's slept, frozen getting shot at too much, and so that you yourself won't die that easily because you were out of position.10: Don't stand on the payload with the shield up when versing another Rein.His shatter will go under your barrier if it's not touching the ground.That's all I can think of now, I might update the list if something comes to my mind.Hope you'll find that at least somewhat helpful.Oh, another one, when fighting against Junkrat, try having your Firestrike ready as much as you can. It does exactly enough damage (100) to destroy the RIP-Tire. And, if you don't have it, and it goes for you, try doing a very quick 180 when it's about to explode. Junk's more likely to try and detonate it behind you, so that you don't block it, and the quick flick can save your life."

It's a super hard skill honestly because you HAVE to balance it between shielding (And it's SO MUCH MORE FUN to swing!)I don't play much Rein anymore...but I did main support back in season 5. One problem I found was my Rein wasn't swinging at the people who were practically in our faces or if they were Nano'd. I Nano Rein's when we got people on us and his shield honestly won't do enough. If you got a Monkey in your face...you NEED to swing at him. He's just gonna hit you through your shield anyway. Plus you get to charge healer ultimates and let your shield regen. This also means that you gotta know when to not swing as well... You got a team behind you sometimes who can really use a shield in some cases. Don't leave em hanging. These cases would be like in a choke where a Junkrat is spamming.Also...Be sure to take up good positioning with your team. I've played a fair amount of Bastion this season. For some reason...I find that people aren't really shielding me. They take up positioning that really wouldn't put their shield to work till it's too late. They use the environment as shielding which is good but the problem with that is...they only need to do that if their shield is getting low. So...if you just started the game and the opponent hasn't pushed yet...you don't have much of a reason to be behind the corner (Unless they're about to be there...) Bastion likes to be where he can see...everything. If you can help him with that he can help keep away Pharah's and burn down tanks."

If you're any other tank on defense, you can shoot people at long range while protecting your teammates on the point or (if you're Winston) jump at the other team, mess them up for several seconds, and then jump back to the point before you get too low on health.With Reinhardt, you just have Fire Strike to try and kill enemies at long range with. Sure, you can charge them, but you'll pretty much be rocketing toward the entire enemy team solo, and you can't do that in a hit and run way which doesn't result in your death the way Winston can.He's great for attacking, though, since your goal as the attacking team is to all get on the point. Having a Reinhardt to hide behind as you advance is very helpful, and a teamfight on the point means that most enemies will be in range of your hammer swings and will have less time to dodge your charges."

It is typically quite hard to sink large amounts of money into physical collectables and be completely unable to recoup it. Reselling (or even official selling) also allows people to purchase individual items they want, which reduces the incentive to gamble on the outcome.People get hung up on the semantics of ""are lootboxes gambling"" a lot. Obviously they are not the exact same thing as gambling in a casino, which is why they haven't fallen under the umbrella of current gambling laws. It is very clear that loot boxes do use the same tactics of psychological manipulation to prey upon compulsive behaviour, however. This leaves them in a very shady grey area that clearly needs new and/or adapted legislation to cover it, otherwise publishers are going to continue doing what they've been doing until a story hits the mainstream news about some kid developing a gambling addiction and bankrupting their parents thanks to unregulated lootbox systems in video games."

""At least it's not as bad as X"" is never a justification for anti-consumer business models. Just because something isn't the worst, doesn't mean it ceases to be bad.Overwatch could easily add in the option for cosmetics or credit bundles to be purchased directly rather than offering a gambling system as the only microtransaction available. This really should be a win-win for everyone involved; money for the developers and well-financed ongoing game support for the consumers. But harming the consumer experience by making lootboxes the default is projected to make insane amounts of money rather than just ""more than enough"", so that's what we get.Never forget that the games industry used to (and still does, in many cases) produce amazing games that turn great profits without the need for loot boxes or other consumer-unfriendly microtransactions."

There's not really a TLDR, but if you want to get the gist of it, skim through the bolded areas.Hi Guys. I’ve been hesitant to post this thread, and instead wanted to wait until after Blizzcon to do so. There’s been a huge surge of concern over Symmetra’s place in the game, so much so that there are 3 Megathreads (all from people in masters, with obvious game sense) on making her more supportive in the general forum, and a reddit thread with 3000+ upvotes. https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759249296?page=1https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20758668065?page=1https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759257002?page=1https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759220930?page=1https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/7afy3b/the_change_for_symmetra_we_didnt_know_we_needed/?utm_term=b41127a9-d761-42ca-93eb-d750b12c3337&amp;utm_medium=search&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=Overwatch&amp;utm_content=1After hearing the recent Q&amp;A regarding Symmetra, it’s kind of clear that the developers are somewhat unsure of her place in the game, and so I’m hoping that this thread will concisely summarize her issues as well as give the developers clear knowledge of how to fix her, rather than recategorizing her. Blizzcon Q&amp;A:Any plans to make Symmetra more viable in competitive? Maybe healing abilities?Symmetra doesn't really fit well in the support category, but doesn't fit in defense either. In the future we might need to revist the categories to better accomodate changes with the game.Symmetra doesn't see much play in high competitive, but her recent toolkit change brought some interesting changes that made her more viable.Please, please, developers. It’s obvious you listen to us, otherwise a Talon Healer wouldn’t have been the next hero despite the massive demand for her. The community obviously wants her to be more supportive. Recategorizing her will not fix her fundamental issues when there are currently better, more intuitive options in the game for her niche (junkrat), as well as more supportive options for her niche coming as well (moira).From the Patch concerning her rework:""We wanted to address two main issues with Symmetra. First, on the whole, we felt that she didn’t feel active enough. Second, due to the nature of her Teleporter, she felt weak in certain situations on different maps and game modesTo address the first point, we replaced her more passive Photon Shield ability with a much more active ability: Photon Barrier. Now, Symmetra can help lead the charge on offense or help shut down a big push on defense by actively blocking damage for your team. For the second point, we noticed players would often switch off of Symmetra once they found themselves in a situation where her Teleporter wasn’t as useful. For example, when playing her on defense on an Assault map, players often used her to defend the first capture point, then quickly switched to another hero if that point fell. To help her feel more useful in more situations, we've given her an alternative to her Teleporter. The Shield Generator is just as important for the enemy to deal with, but is useful in more situations. .""This is important to note, as she is the most passive support out of all 5, and she is also the most situational. She is not viable on attack, as the intention of the rework. The first rework failed its intended purpose.You can read through this or skim to the bolded sections. While a lot of people argue that Symmetra is strong within her niche. That is precisely the issue with her. When she was most viable was within her Niche on chokes such as Hanamura, Eichenwalde, and Volksaya defense. There were numerous complaints on how hard chokes were to break through, so developers made several balancing adjustments, both to the maps, and characters who had either abilities or mobility to deal with the chokes. From that point onwards,  new map development gave a lot of alternative pathways and elevation that lessened her Niche's effectiveness and gave numerous easy options for counterplay, not to mention she’s not very viable outside of her niche, either.The point? The newest maps, newest characters, and newest buffs to heroes mean that her original Niche is shrinking, and her viability outside that niche is dismal if not compromising to the team. AKA: She’s not relevant to the current version of the game.The elephant in the room: She is the utility support, however, she is the only support whose utility mechanics are not readily available for use (speed, discord, damage boost) while the other support who has utility on cooldown has two highly active, flexible utility abilities that have a variety of uses that outclass Photon Barrier, and have less counters than her turrets do.  The other issue is that all of these support alternatives not only have better utility in their actual kit (not taking into account ultimates), but all the other support utility is in conjunction to healing. She was designed as a damage mitigating, utility support, that defends the backlines; however, almost all of the support in her kit comes from her ultimate, which makes her the only character who is balanced entirely around the merit of her ultimate- which is one of her design flaws, if this patch from Blizzard is any indication:Game-changing ultimate abilities were coming up a bit too frequently. This change helps keep them in check while still allowing them to be powerful. (universal nerf to ultimate charge)If a character is balanced around an ultimate, then it is likely that their kit is lacking. Symmetra has the lowest ultimate costs in the game, and can keep her ultimate up indefinitely. This should raise concerns as to what part of her kit makes this necessary in her design. They wanted her to more engaging in the rework, with more of a capacity for proactive and reactive engagement, but her kit has most of the most passive abilities in the game. Also important to note, if all of her her supportive merit is funneled into her destructible ultimates, she will always lose to Zen/Lucio, who don’t need their ultimate or to keep a structure alive to be supportive. Not only that, but her supportive capacity was originally her E, which rightly means that her original design did not involve a passive ultimate to provide support.Please, complete her kit. We know this is something you’re capable of doing. Within the last month, you completed Mercy’s kit due to the feedback of DPS mains. This is feedback from the people who play the character. Please fix her.She doesn’t  NEED  to heal, but she suffers from an incomplete kit as a support character. (if you need proof she's a support) Luminums videos show her potential as a support, but watching his videos often makes it clear to me that her kit is just not as cohesive as the other characters in the game, even the defense characters which skeptics seem to be convinced she is. His best plays are supportive plays, so she obviously has potential as a support. She just plays more like an offensive support, similar to Zen.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1GvmBQk8-shttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flWwBFCTjsUhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBbe7ylCy18(this was patched but shows how he needs high game sense, and to be innovative to a crazy level to succeed with her limited kit) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sJwuH1BMwY(this video shows the potential of team flanks at 4:10) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YhsywtY2OM(and this video shows why symmetra falls short as a support… she needs her team to support her for her to support them. She’s more follow-through dependent than any other support because she lacks support in her actual kit, but people will troll you because they see you as a “troll pick”) He makes great plays, saving his team from reinhardt ultimates, making team flanks, etc. But really, while that’s amazing, there’s not much he can do inbetween that except try to make picks. While other offsupports like lucio/zen, have their utility up (speed/discord) in addition to no cooldown, no ultimate options for heals (heal aura/harmony orb).Quality of Life adjustments for Symmetra are necessary, but if that is all she receives, she likely won't have a place in the game as the game evolves.The best, and most commonly suggested Quality of Life suggestions are:Turrets: Reduce the delay in placing and ""activating"" the turrets after you deploy them, as well as remove the slow that Symmetra is afflicted with when placing them.Ultimates: Let them be seen through walls for teammates, as well as willful deconstruction of her barrier generator so a skilled Symmetra can change her nesting location, similarly to how a widowmaker will change her sniping location. Let her deconstruct her teleporter to redeem some of her ult charge if the charges are running low. Also, allow her to build her ultimates on walls and ceilings at slightly longer range, so her setups become less predictable.(via AConstelle) Remove the 5-6 second delay she has on gaining ult when her Shield Generator is destroyed. The delay isn't there for TP, but it is for Shield Gen for some reason, and 6 seconds is a lot of time for Sym. Also the blue line indicating the Shield Gen's radius would be swell.Photon Barrier: There have been numerous suggestions for this ability. Increase the charges on it, decrease the cooldown, give her more control over it. The biggest consistent complaint I've seen with this ability is the fact that Symmetra has a harder time contributing with this support utility than other supports have contributing with their utility that is often on a lower cooldown or does not have a cooldown while simultaneously being easier skills to contribute with. This ability needs to be able to compete with an offhealing slot, period. It’s her only active support ability. The other point I want to bring up is that she is the only support who has a viable alternative to rez, which a lot of people are concerned about.[Moderator edit - I removed the direct call-out to the Dev team.  The Feedback here is greatly appreciated but the idea of the forums is a discussion among players.  The Dev team has access to the discussion and may take part in the discussion but the main focus is the discussion.  Not shutting this down just trying to redirect the focus :) ]"

More than anything it's to shed light on the issues that Symmetra is facing and how she's becoming obsolete with the evolving nature of the game. These ideas are the kind of ideas Symmetra players wonder about when they think of ""viability"" in the sense that other characters have that fall under the category of support, without boxing her into something as arbitrary as a healer. I've tried to limit the amount of ""reworking"" suggestions in this thread, but at this point, I'm leaning more towards it due to her place in the evolving nature of the game and competitive team comps. If you have an idea you feel is within her playstyle and will bring her viability, please list it in this forum. Ideas that have been thrown out:(Kyleesie Ideas)New Features to Existing Abilities:Photon BarrierChange the shape of the barrier into a sphere so it can block damage from all angles, and fully protect someone running with it.Health readuced to 900 down from 1025.- OR -Provides 75 shields to any ally it comes into contact with. The shields decay slowly 3 seconds after leaving a 5 meter radius of the Turret projecting the barrierReddit Idea:Let her place supportive turrets.(The issue with this is it’s not as flexible as other support utility and is too area based. Which in the end would cause the same potential problems as before)My idea:Her Glove as a Secondary weapon, similar to torb and mercy, unlocks a new ability under the primary fire of this ""weapon"": Photon Shield (yes, bring it back)Channeled ability, resource meter of 12-15 seconds. 30 Yard range. Grants 40 barrier health to your target per second. Can give up to 50 extra health. When not channeling, will degenerate at a rate of 5 hp per second. Barrier health is the same mechanic used in sound barrier and doomfists passive, which is why I suggest using this mechanic as a ""psuedo-heal"". This would grant her a place in the game as the only support counter available to Ana's grenade. She'll still primary play as a defensive dps, but this will give her defensive support utility that helps sustain the team and the main healer, without actually making her a healer. The way that barrier health functions, it would work somewhere between healing and the original photon shield. That is, that instead of providing a flat hp bonus, it would give a max of 50 ""bonus health"", but since it's barrier health, any missing HP would have to be filled with Symmetra's resource meter degenerating barrier health (like doomfist) before the ""bonus"" hp would apply.These suggestions, or variations of it, are the most popular on the forums. I’d even be willing to have her gun range nerfed, as lower SR seems to hate it, in exchange for more utility.Basically the same as her old ability, but not a flat hp bonus. Since it’s barrier health, missing hp has to be given before giving the bonus.Lastly, this is a quote that I really like from one of the other very well thought out Symmetra threads (Kyleesie's thread) that I really enjoyed.  This basically sums up opinion on why on why it may be necessary to give her a ""pseudo-heal""/stronger damage mitigation, while staying true to the developers vision for her. You don't need to make her a healer! That's the beauty of it. You just need to make her sustain to the point the team doesn't miss an offhealer :)Comments: I know the developers intentionally designed Sym without any traditional healing. However, while I respect their philosophy to design a unique way for her to function as a support, I strongly feel that her inability to heal (especially while classified as a ""support"" hero) negatively affects how players perceive her in the game. Simply put, Symmetra confuses people. New players are unsure of what she is used for, and veteran competitive and pro players don't value her utility over other support heroes who can actually heal. As a result, Symmetra is stifled by negative opinions, and those who choose to play her receive an egregious and unfair amount of toxicity and blame.Ideas added later based on discussions within the thread:Mohock Ideas: Letting her be stronger anti-mobility by having turrets affect things such as Dash/Blink, allowing her to set the base of her ultimate in a predetermined location before she gets it.Crestren Ideas: Allowing her to have more buildables, such as bridges, elevators, or structures that grant support to the team.Dr.Fate Idea:: Symmetra is granted a passive that gives sustain, similar to Lucio but exclusively affecting shield HP pools."
"607","https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759380928","[MEGATHREAD-UNCAPPED] Symmetras place in the game","1509803820","Here are some of my potential ideas that could improve her kit and make her more viable:Turret-Survivability:Give her turrets thermoptic camo like Sombras. The turret stays invisible until an enemy comes in reach, decloaks and shoots. After a few seconds out of combat they recloak again. This would allow for more flexible and creative traps and prevents Tracer/DVa/Reaper from shootgunsniping them across the map.Turret-Placement: Give her turrets the flying behavior like the shieldcore, but instead of getting destroyed by hitting a surface, the turret sticks to it. This would solve the immobility issue while placing them, they could be used to contest high ground more effective and they would be more viable to push a point. Bonus buff if they would start fireing midflight.Turret-Slowing: Slowing effects from the turrets (or Mei) could be applied to ""teleport""-abilities like Tracers Blink or Genjis Dash, resulting in a shortening of the traveling distance equivalent of the percentage the hero is slowed down. A 25% Movement speed reduction from one turret would lead to a 10,5m dash instead of 14m.Ultimates: Let her place the base plate of her ultimates in advance even with 0% on her ultcharge and activate them when they are ready. You would set up the base with Q and could change the placement at any time by building a new one in case you change your mind or they get destroyed. I would even disable their shields until they are activated so flankers could dispose of them quickly if discovered. Pressing Q with 100% ultcharge would bring up the same image as of now of the sg/tp and you can select to activate the existing base by looking up or build a new one by looking down towards the ground. This way, Symmetra players don't have to leave the battle for prolonged times to set up her ults at a good spot and they can be activated right as the fight breaks loose to get a better impact."

Mobility is uncontested in this game, and that's why characters like Mei, even with a phenomenal kit, are scarcely seen in the game anymore. Improving anti-mobility kits, especially when tracer and genji are uncontested as flankers in the pro scene, might be something this game desperately needs."

The only thing that can counter tracers blink is sombras hack, i think this game could benefit from one or two more.My proposed change would apply the reduction to the momentum of a character instead of the absolute velocity. This would also make it better against charging reinhards, jumping winstons and rocketboosting pharahs while the immobile character interaction stays the same. To balance this change the turrets could get a little bit of damage reduced to emphasize the support aspect."

On top of that, slow down and increase the size of the barrier a bit. That way she can give tanks a small break when their defenses get overwhelmed. If they give her healing, she'll instantly become viable.If they do the rest of my suggestion, she should be some where between a tank, dps, and defense. Giving her team more flexibility on deciding if they want to got single healer, tank, or dps, without outright hurting the effectiveness of the team."
"611","https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759380928","[MEGATHREAD-UNCAPPED] Symmetras place in the game","1509803820","I've played Sym for over 200 hours and she's carried me from about 1700 to about 60 points away from Diamond. One suggestion I've had for a while is to add a simple 1HP barrier to her turrets, as a barrier will always absorb the impact from blow no matter how much it does. This would prevent them from being destroyed by something like D.Va's ult, Rein charge, Genji's Swift Strike, Lucio's Boop, Junkrat's Concussion Mine, etc. It gives Symmetra more staying power because there are less ways to counter her turrets, which are her main mode of support, but they still only effectively have 2HP so any automatic weapon fire can still dispose of them quickly.Another is that Symmetra just needs to take less time to do things across the board. She takes too long to deploy turrets, which then also have to activate so around 2 seconds from deployment to activation time for a turret which makes her harder to use on attack since she needs so much setup time. Her photon barrier needs to deploy earlier in the animation and closer to Symmetra, there are so many times where I have perfectly timed a block only to have the Hook/Flashbang/Widow Headshot go through it and then the barrier floats away from my corpse.I also think an interesting buff would be to either have her alt fire charge faster or move faster. She has the only basic attack that goes through barriers at range and, while useful in its current state, can sum up to poke damage if they have two healers. I think allowing it to either move or charge faster would give Symmetra a better chance on attack as she would be able to deal massive, unforgiving amounts of damage to the enemy team. These are mostly just QoL suggestions, as far as I'm concerned. The only straight buff is the charge or movement speed, and I think that's pretty minor tbh. The only serious kit alteration I could think would be to re-add back the photon shield at 25 and let her stack that with her shield generator, with the caveat that the 25 shields disappear if she dies. That would allow Symmetra to have a somewhat better impact before she's able to get an ultimate up, but can be punished if she were to die."

She' won't have a place in the game regardless, except at a lower tier where her gun ""carries"" because they don't have mechanical skill. In fact, I'm pretty sure if it wasn't for the range buff on her gun (which I remember prior to the rework no one really even asked for) players with great positioning and game sense wouldn't have even been able to climb to masters, because her standard kit (not ultimates) is really just that outclassed."

If she's melting low SR due to her gun, it's probably a good idea not to increase her killing potential (which is honestly fine). A sphere photon shield does little to support her kills with the low range of her gun, while it does help her team move forward. The glove isn't healing, is a unique mechanic, basically the same concept of her original photon shield, but now she has a way to grant team sustain when she's not dpsing from the comfort of her nest."

People like that cant even climb to plat with her.Sym was strong because there wasn't many strong heroes back there but with recent buffs to other heroes and new heroes coming out, her kit become too weak because whenever a new patch note come out, she is passively nerfed one way or another.Even Luminum has been screaming about buffing her. Aside from Luminum, Hoshi and Stevo, no one would be able to reach their level especially Luminum as his skilled plays are incredible with limited kit. But the level of blocking all the Tracer and Rein's ult, even using turrets to block Doomfist's Rocket Punch is extremely high, if you dont main her to at least Diamond, its impossible to do it.Recently, Moira is out and with her mobility, she can outplay Sym with ease. Believe me or not, Sym will start to fall back along with Torb (really, these two dont need to have their skin designed in WC, no one gonna pick them)Sometimes i feel i could have been in Master by spending 150 hours on another char instead of sym but i love her and seeing her at the bottom of the game and being hated by most of the community is really sad."

My issue with Symmetra is that her supportive potential is near non-existent if your team has no awareness. I included some of Luminums gameplay in my post to illustrate this. He was doing a phenomenal job attempting to support his team, but they weren't taking his openings and not letting him support. In turn, it was like he didn't do anything, even though he was working extra hard with his limited kit.Imagine if an entire character's kit was similar to Zarya's grav in the sense that it needs friendly follow up to actually do anything? Yeah, that's symmetra right now as a support :("

Someone posted this on another Sym thread.10/28/2017 07:26 AMPosted by ImWithDerpBeen trying to think of a way to translate more of Symmetra's architectural skills into gameplay and make her more interesting to play.BTW, this idea is focused more on making Symm more fun, not necessarily more balanced. If something like this does get implemented then Symm would hopefully receive balance tweaks to make her viable without being OP.---Secondary weapon: Hard Light ConstructorPrimary fire launches an orb-like object in a straight line that sticks to the first surface it hits. Up to two of these orbs can exist at once. Like her turrets, orbs have a cooldown but can store several charges.If both orbs are placed within line of sight of each other, a hard light structure is created between them. The type of structure depends on whether the orbs are on floors/ceilings/walls.Illustration of different structure types: https://i.imgur.com/ygMBfDT.pngDetails of different structure types:Bridges stay in place, allowing allies to walk over themElevators move between both orbs, carrying any allies standing on themAllies standing above/under a Power Field gain increased damage (and/or rate of fire?)Allies who walk through a Boost Screen gain a temporary movement speed boost (and/or a temporary shield?)Secondary fire deactivates active orbs/structures.The orbs can be destroyed but have regenerating shields to protect themselves like Symm's teleporter/shield generator.I personally like it as it does fit in Sym's character. It also helps alleviate mobility to non mobile heroes (like Ana, Zen, Mei) so she can play a role in that and help her team move around better. And it does fit as it provides another utility to help support her team as shes not a healer type, she supports her team with her utility."

"663","https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759546674","what your overwatch class says about you","1511343000","I feel like the main difference between offense and defense players is not one of playstyle, but of personality.  I actually think that most of the offense and defense characters fall solidly under the role of DPS, and are pretty interchangeable in most situations.  What separates them is the appeal of the characters themselves.  The defense characters are weirder in both the design of their gameplay loop and their aesthetics.  They are more niche.  When you look at the offense heroes, they seem more iconic, and recognizable.  The assault rifle character who has a sprint and regenerating health like in CoD.  The revolver-using cowboy, the snappy spitfire with akimbo pistols.  Then you look at the defense characters and it's like...what?  The autistic girl who attacks you with hard-light projections and an insta-lock energy beam?  The semi-sentient robot who spends have the game stationery?  The archery ""sniper"" who is more effective in your face than from far-range.  These characters are weird and niche, in comparison to the offense characters who are more standard and viable in every situation.As a result, people who main offense characters typically want to reenact some character they enjoy from popular media, or enjoy playing a character that feels similar to others they've played before.  Defense players typically want to play something weird or rare, and want to play a character who you typically won't see in your average shooter."

Also, that ""Only been implemented recently"" thing is propaganda from the ISPs. The truth is that the FCC has been enforcing it since the 90s but it was technically discovered that they couldn't because it wasn't an established law. Therefore, it has practically existed for a long time.That's also one of the arguments, I mean if nothing has changed from the beginning of the internet to 2015, then 2015 to now why bother changing it? Why not just let the current law stay in place and do nothing? What do we stand to gain by repeal?Well, the issue with the 2015 argument is that 2015 wasn't the actual first advent of Net Neutrality. It was just a reinforcement of existing rules, necessary because Verizon found a loophole and claimed that the previous form NN couldn't be enforced. Thus the rules got changed a bit so it could be enforced once more (called Title 2). In practice, NN has effectively been around since before the 2000's, just in a weaker form until cable companies forced it to become stronger in response to their advances."

Her only true counters are soldier 76 and mccree (some other characters too but It depends how skilled a player is). We need a character to fly that can directly counter Pharah. Sure there's Mercy when using her ult, but she isn't intended for combat, and her gun sucks. We need a character who can fly with a gun that is NOT explosive to counter Pharah. If we had a flying character with an assault rifle for example, they would be able to fly up and shoot pharah out of the sky. It would also encourage people to get better at Pharah and try to be able to aim at flying targets. Right now, the only flying character you would encounter is another pharah (or an ulting mercy, but she can barely control her flight so it's easy to aim at her) and the odds of having to 1v1 another pharah in anything other than a 1v1 match is very slim, so nobody even cares about being able to aim at flying targets.

Exactly. I understand why they put it in, I really do. But there is still a way we can all have nice things and I really think this would be the perfect solution. Honestly, most times I dont even care about the XP at all, I just want to have fun with my friends but then I get kicked half way through a game.This is especially frustrating because you can NOT queue up for 8 Player FFA with your friends, so they tell you to set up a custom game, then you get kicked half way through a match you were winning just to rejoin in last place?

We wanted to give you a heads up on what’s happening with the targeting on Moira’s Biotic Grasp.On the PTR, we made a number of improvements to the mechanism that Moira uses to select a target. Now players can more accurately select a target when multiple targets are in the field of view (which resolves issues like this: [url=""https://streamable.com/rosvo""]https://streamable.com/rosvo[/url]), and the new system can better discern which target is closest to the player's reticle when multiple targets are valid.  When we made this change, we did our best to make the everything feel as close to her original system as possible, but since the new mechanism uses a different functionality, it didn’t convert perfectly for a number of heroes. Generally, the larger heroes are a little harder to target, while the smaller heroes are much closer to her original behavior. The training bots also need to be adjusted, as they are by far the worst offender in the new system. Since it wasn't our intention to do anything but improve Moira's targeting, we’re hoping to test a new configuration on the PTR either late this week or early next. Thank you so much for surfacing the issue for us; these reports are incredibly useful for us when it comes to tracking down bugs.People are so quick to jump to conclusions sometimes."

She hasn't been used really since season 2 or 3. I think she can use any of these or a combo of some:1. I'm thinking make her an anti-lucio player since he's popping back into the meta somewhat. She can slow with her gun but no longer freeze ppl outside of her ultimate. So her priFire is only a slow tactic with a slightly wider cone and shorter range like old Symm beam. Cuz freezing people is useless unless you're a low rank or going against a dva or road. This slow would be like 50% or maybe 33%. 2. Her priFire can be put on the ground to either speed boost allies or slow enemies. We'll just go by like 25-50%. it'll last for 4 seconds. Probably would have a lot of bugs from this though with all the surfaces in the game... But it seems logical to slide on ice.3. Make her cryo-freeze continue to slide so that she is more mobile, and not extremely easy to kill when stalling on 2Cp, ya know, the only place she's used by pros. At least her cryo-freeze FINALLY gets rid of antinade status4. Her ice wall and cryo-freeze leaves behind a trail of ice to be used like #2 suggested.5. The ability to wave and right click at the same time. She shoots right handed but waves with her left. Let us BM better Blizz!6. Her ulti still going off even if she dies. She's throwing something. D.va bomb happens if she dies. Why can't mei taste the sweet glory of the meta?I think some of these need to be there to help the pick rates. Because OW has a problem with how defined the meta is. It's much better nowadays with every tank being used in the World Cup and all the healers, but its still normally the same 6 dps because they offer the most."
