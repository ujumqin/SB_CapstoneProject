But again, her pickrate is much higher than her peers around her.I also don't think either of these stats really matters though, because both list Symmetra and Torbjorn as having the highest winrates, even though both of them are commonly said to be in the ranks of the worst heroes in the game.Not to mention, Ana just got a huge buff which could see her being used more often and to much greater effect, especially since Mercy was nerfed. But these haven't had the time to have a great effect since it's only been 4 days since the patch.Clearly winrate isn't a great metric to use in discussions like this. ","dootleloot"

Sure it would be horrible to have to pay piecemeal for packages of our regularly used websites. However, the really horrific thing is that the up and coming competitors to those existing services will never have an opportunity to compete. Just think for a second about all of the services you regularly use like Reddit, Twitter, Discord, Steam, Twitch, etc. A lot of these services didn't exist 10 or 15 years ago. Imagine a world where the new competitors never get a chance to outcompete the established ones because the new competitors can't get the preffered bandwidth and even if they could, consumers would have no idea to add them to their packages. Imagine a world where you are still stuck with Hotmail, MapQuest, AOL instant messenger, Friendster/Myspace. Even putting money aside the abolishment of net neutrality threatens the Internet as a home for new and better ways to do things. We will stagnate. ","bernibear"

Of course, this is speculation, but a giant like Blizzard or Valve would have no problem shelling out money if it meant that they were the only ones on the market doing it.

It aims to protect end-users and simultaneously to guarantee the continued functioning of the internet ecosystem as an engine of innovation. Reforms in the field of roaming should give end-users the confidence to stay connected when they travel within the Union, and should, over time, become a driver of convergent pricing and other conditions in the Union."" I'm not a lawyer, but essentially the EU says you can't discriminate between data. You can't let one website go faster than another website, and you can't say ""No you can't use this website"" as the ISP.However, you are allowed to charge what you want for data. This is the difference - you can still access websites and still do all of the normal internet things, however you can ALSO pay extra to get unlimited data to a specific web service. the worst outcomes from this loop hole are either: ""People pay less for internet to everything"" or ""People pay the same ammount for internet, but some sites are cheaper"".This basically gets around the issue that the US has because 1) The EU has a large amount of competition and 2) prices can only go down because of this.

There is such a high barrier to entry for competition that the Obama administration put rules into place so that the individuals that currently have market share cannot take advantage of their current domination of the market - akin to what the FCC and the government did in the 1980s for telephone lines. The government deemed these companies as ""common carriers"" of public goods necessary for every day commerce and life to continue. New Internet companies cannot just ""start up"" similar to why gas and electricity companies cannot just ""start up."" Google Fiber (Google's ISP) is only available in a few cities across the United States because it is costing them billions of dollars to lay down the infrastructure necessary to have a reliable network. These regulations are necessary to limit corporate greed and profiteering on access to the internet, a concept deemed fundamental to human rights by the United Nations in 2016. I do not think this is an issue on giving the government power - but limiting the intensity of monopoly on a public good. ","XStasisX"

Outside of major cities, you don't have an option for your ISP.  And even in cities, it can still be limited based on where you live.  With internet being essential in today's society, it is the same as having a water bill.  TV is a luxury and they're trying to use a similar and more profitable business model for internet.  And as far as giving the government power, it CAN be a good thing.  Government regulation is why we in the US don't have lead in our water.  It's why air quality has drastically improved since the 80s.  And in this case, it's not that the government is getting control of the internet, it's that the ISPs are getting less control, which most benefits the consumer.  Too much government regulation is indeed a bad thing, but it does prevent major corporations from exploiting consumers.",""

The main issue that puts individuals for or against net neutrality is where you believe the best practices of service providers or its users.  It's an argument between the potential and sincerity of industry progress or individual and collective usage rights.","TheZestyAlex"

The problem now is that ISPs don't like businesses like Netflix or VoIP companies because streaming services and voice streaming services take up more bandwidth overall than other things like web browsing. So ... This wasn't a problem before 2015 because ISPs still had to compete and innovate during this time to get customers, however, that isn't the case anymore because the big ISPs have been buying up smaller ISPs to have a monopoly on the market in their respective areas. Hence why in a lot of areas you have only two options (and a lot of times one option)because the barrier of entry is so high and expensive. Also local government support the big ISPs monopolies of their areas due to lobbying and lies. So this is why we need net neutrality because if we don't have it, big ISPs will start charging extra for companies like Netflix, for priority access to the internet, and Netflix will just pass the cost onto the consumer anyways because they're just not going to up and just pay extra from the goodness of their heart. This is why I'm also in the boat that the internet should be a public utility because everyone needs it and uses it. Hopefully that explains it a little. At least that's my understanding of the whole ordeal.",""

To add to that.  Netflix (being the banner example) was being extorted by Comcast in 2014.  This started that round of Open Internet (Net Neutrality) conversations.  Just before we actually got NN, Netflix entered an agreement with Comcast to use them as an interconnect partner and magically the bandwidth problem went away.  It's also not just about bandwidth.  It's about perceived ""fast lanes"" to businesses.  Most larger businesses would love to have their customers see their site the fastest, so they'd pay (just like paying to have higher search result ranking).  They would/will take any advantage they can get and the ISPs want to be able to offer that.  Under the current rules they can't.  Then you have the issue that while ISPs don't want to build out in certain areas, they actively block other companies and even municipalities from creating their own internet service.  So these mega-companies, want to have their cake (which you made), eat it, and make you pay to watch.","QuriousB"

One thing you can do to mitigate this is to communicate with your fellow support (assuming you're not stuck solo healing, as I'm sure you will often find yourself doing). If a Tracer or Genji is trying to go for either you and the two of you momentarily pocket each other (say, Zenyatta orbs you and you keep your beam on him) then it becomes very hard for them to kill either of you alone and should discourage them from pursuing the kill further. Keep in mind though that doing this means the rest of your team is getting no heals, which can easily translate to a win for the flanker--be sure to get right back to them when it feels safe. If your second healer is a Lucio or Moira, then definitely let them know if you need help, as they're the best at peeling against flankers with boops and the auto-aim thingy.Other heroes that are good at helping you: Backline DPS (typically Soldier or McCree for example) and the off-tanks (Zarya with her bubbles, D.Va with her defense matrix, and Roadhog with his hook threatening to kill enemy DPS). Having any one of these protecting you makes it hard for a flanker to pick you off, and they'll often have to disengage.Of course, sometimes your teammates won't communicate too well with you and will not come to your aid (a frustrating thing about playing with randoms), in which case you should just try your best to stay alive on your own. Use Mercy's mobility to your advantage--if a flanker is going for you, you can guardian angel to a tank to discourage them from pursuing further. Also take advantage of teammates who are on high ground. If you're ever in danger on the low ground, fly up to your fellow Soldier controlling the high ground (if he's there). If there's a Pharah on your team then she's also an obvious choice to fly to for safety. In general, it's important to be aware of your own team's positioning (for more reasons than just staying safe), on top of the enemy team's positioning. Situational awareness is key.Those are just a few general tips for staying alive, which in my opinion is the most important part of playing support. Good players will focus supports, and dead supports can't sustain the team. A lot of it will also just come with time. Good awareness keeps you alive (and also helps you use the rest of your kit to the best of your ability), so just play the game and ask yourself what you could've done differently every time you get picked off.Mercy isn't quite one of my main heroes so I hope this was helpful!

Don't go for the risky Rez on the Genji who died way out of position by the enemy spawn, don't try to heal him when he's like that either, since your life is worth more than his. Being able to at least passably play a couple other heroes if you main Mercy is a good idea, so you're not completely SOL if someone else picks her in a Competitive match. Valkyrie is great for pushing if you alternate healing when your team is damaged and damage boosting when your team is at high health. Also her pistol does a surprising amount of damage, use it to chase off or outright kill that pesky Tracer or Genji your dps refuses to peel.","Akiram"

Just learn to position yourself properly - you'll get more and more used to this over time. When you die (and you will die - so, soooo many times) consciously think about how you could have positioned yourself better. Remember that the enemy team will hunt you, if they don't they're doing it wrong. So stay with your allies, have an escape strategy, and don't be afraid to whip out your pistol if a Tracer catches you alone (if there isn't an immediate available teammate to shift to). You are the most mobile support hero, flaunt it. When you pop your Valkyrie, you go super saiyan. Stay high up, utilize that chain heal, and Rez often. If there's someone that can shoot you out of the sky, try to fly behind structures or behind buildings. Your healing beam gets a range boost so distance yourself from the danger.Once you get the hang of zooming around, learn which heroes need you the most. You're not always supposed to heal the hero with the lowest health first. Example: If your Tracer running back at critical health but your Reinhardt is at the front line at half health with his shield broken, you take care of Rein first. Always take care of whoever's in more immediate danger. Learn to read the situation. As Mercy, you'll be making these split second decisions constantly in the heat of battle. Damage boosting is super satisfying as well. Learn who gets the most out of it on your team. Junkrats live for that sweet blue beam, especially if you're facing a shield heavy comp. On the other hand, you do not need to be boosting a Widow. You'll just give away her position.You should also be making callouts (this goes for all supports). You get dived at, just a simple ""Genji on me,"" or ""Sombra behind,"" will suffice. Whether or not you team will do their job and peel back for you is a complete coin toss. I personally just shift away and hug my tank until I know it's safe. Another common line you should use is ""Peak me."" You need line of sight to shift and if you have any decent teammates, they will know to peak a corner or ledge to let you fly to them if you're lagging behind or gliding into the abyss.Most importantly, have fun. Don't let the toxicity get to you - Mercy mains are prime targets for blame. A lot of people don't get that the skill that comes with playing Mercy isn't mechanical, it's visceral and game sense oriented. Hope that helps! Happy healing!","TempusFugitive_"

For Tracer: then just aim for tanks then as sticking them is a lot easier. Zenyatta’s Discord: SUPER hard to get. Very luck based. If you have a Zarya on your team, and she can pull off a good grav, then Discord the people within the grav and hope to God that your teammates focus on them. Without Zarya, it just takes a ton of luck. Transcendence: the best opportunity is if a Zarya gravs your team, and then the enemy tries to follow up with some Ultimates. That’s the most common way people get Transcendence is just negating Zarya combos. I personally got it from negating a Reinhardt Earthshatter that a Genji then tried to capitalize on. It took a LONG time to get it though and I had many tries. As for the other tanks, Zarya is a great tank whose barriers add a ton of support. Don’t discredit Orisa, in the right hand, she’s super capable. A lot of people use her to melt enemy shield’s, help advance pushes, and have a dynamic shield to quickly adjust to the flow of battle.

I don't think I've ever seen someone that pointedly avoids healing tanks; it's generally because of priority, danger, or payoff. For example, healing an Orisa behind a shield (unless on critical) is going to be slightly lower on my list than boosting a soldier who's ulting, esp. since the Orisa's shield will stay up after death.Alternatively, sometimes I'm literally blind and actually don't notice you even if you're standing right in front of my face/right behind, so there's that too haha.","Minikirby"

This is something that I don't have a great grasp of myself and you'll just have to learn over time as you play the game, but some examples:Winston and D.Va are extremely good on any map with extreme high ground (which is, admittedly, a lot of them). Take Gibraltar 2nd point on Attack for instance. If the defenders are able to set up on top of the shuttle it can be tough to challenge them with a Reinhardt or Orisa, but Winston and D.Va can contest them directly.Conversely, deathball-y comps will work best on maps that are more ""flat."" Think King's Row, Eichenwalde 1st and 3rd points, or certain KOTH points like Oasis University. So, Reinhardt as a main tank here can work well, because Winston/D.Va's capability to jump high ground matters less.Orisa works well on points that are easy to turtle up on or just block a choke on. This tends to be mean most first point defenses on 2CP or Hybrid maps, like Horizon where setting up on point just feels natural with her, or Hanamura or Hollywood where the attacking team has to break through a single (shielded) choke.For the most part, if you're good enough you can run anything anywhere so don't take any of the above as rules that are set in stone. If you pick Orisa or something on every single map and it seems to work out, then fine. But if you notice yourself struggling then maybe take a look at the map (and/or the enemy team comp as well as your own) and ask yourself if your pick is optimal or not. It's not always easy to tell, so just practice using them and see what works and what doesn't. ","_Walpurgisyacht_"

Winston and D.va are much better in mobile comps since they can move around and they don't have a lot of shielding capabilities so it's more difficult to make a slow moving comp with them since your team won't have any way of blocking lots of damage. Hog and Zarya are off-tanks, kind of dps-tank hybrids; these are the kind of tanks you'd pick if you want two tanks and already have one. Zarya synergizes well with dps heroes like genji or pharah, or any hero with an AOE ult really since that's exactly what her ult's purpose is. I'm not sure about Hog, since I rarely ever play him. I hope this was helpful. It can also depend on what the enemy team is playing. Generally it's bad to play a winston against heroes like bastion, reaper or junkrat since those heroes can wreck in close range combat and winston's tesla cannon only locks on to close range targets. Other than that it's complicated. ","Tristinmathemusician"

Then you'll start to get invites to play on 3, 4, 5, or even 6 stacks with others who care about team comp.If I solo Q, I okay who it takes, and communicate as if the team cares. Because of that attitude, I rarely solo queue anymore, and in stacks I often her paired with people who love playing Mercy.

I notice the same thing happen to me when I haven’t played McCree for a while, usually queuing up in deathmatch for a while can help. Just remember that the headshots aren’t always the easiest thing to do, especially on Genjis who may’ve been jumping around before your stun.

As for missing Flashbanged targets, that's mostly practice until your muscle memory let's you just do it, plus practicing enough will increase your confidence in playing him, which helps, too. Taking a little time off can help if you're feeling tilted about it. Also, you could just Fan the Hammer into Genji's chest, not as stylish as a headshot, but effective.","Akiram"

Since in Overwatch, the server has final decision, you will always be playing with delayed information. Maybe part of the problem is that Doomfist's Rocket Punch hitbox is very small and the ability moves Doomfist forward quite fast, so it is relatively easy to miss someone by a fraction of a second (enough for lag to be an issue, apparently). More so than, say, Reinhardt's charge.Here's my view on OP's examples:1.1 - Seems a genuine example, although it could be attributed to a near miss combined with a 59ms ping.1.2 - Moira simply jumped over the charge. You can see when Doomfist is underneath her she 'stands up', which is what happens when you walk/stand on top of enemies.1.3 - In both of these cases, the enemy has already moved out of the way of the RP, but since the ping is (at times) &gt; 80ms, this will be skewed from the player's perspective.1.4 - If you watch this frame by frame, you can see Winston has clearly jumped away even before RP was near.1.5 - While this player did not admit it, he jumped right before releasing RP, hence he missed the tire.1.6 - Lucio jumped over this one. Clearly. You can see him leave the screen at the top while the player was looking forward, i.e. Lucio was a long way from the ground.1.7 - The Reinhardt player baited Doomfist here. You can see him start moving back the last two or so frames Reinhardt is in view. Combine that with a &gt; 70ms RTT (which is at least 4 frames of additional delay) and his story definitely checks out. Doomfist did not go 'through', even from his view it was grazing at best.  A possible change could be to increase the Rocket Punch hitbox. I would steer away from trying to make these hits count if the server's perspective saw the rocket punch miss since this will reward high ping Doomfist play. Which is probably a bad thing.EDIT: Bug 2 is the exact same thing, except that the game client predicted a hit and played the wrong animation after which the server denied the hit.EDIT: Bug 5 seems lag-related as well?","OnceWasABreadPan"

So many of these bugs are situational and will be very hard to fix correctly without tweaking something else too far (see: Roadhog). This is likely why not much has changed since his release.In order to fix a software bug, the variables which cause the bug must be known. This means that the bug needs to be reproducible. While the footage above is helpful, it still may not be enough to consistently reproduce the behavior.OP clearly feels that Doomfist is not in a great spot, and this is a far more useful and more constructive post than simply whining like every other balance-related post. That being said, there's still no guarantee that Blizzard can do anything about many of these bugs.","Deku_The_Madman"

Not that the code itself is weird (which it might be) but that its interactions make it buggy as fuck. I don't know if you play the game or know something about it but his ultimate is badically an ability where you mark someone and if that person dies within the duration of the mark you get to control their character as a ghost. So you have badically your own character and also the other persons that you can control. Do you get why it has those weird interactions now? I mean there are times when the champ isnt even in the game being played but he still affects it somehow and creates a major bug. As for the fixing. For a game that size its important that they prioritize which things are more important. They can't work on everything at the same time. If the champ is barely being played in both competively and casual he simply can't be a priority. It's also important to note that the developing team had said that at this point it's much easier to completely remake the champ than fix his bugs. and of course he isn't a priority for that because there are other champs that need it much more currently. Mordekaiser (the champ with the bugs) is still perfectly playable for almost all levels until you get to the top (which is top 0.002% of all players). The champ has minor bug but he sits above 51-53% winrate most the time. Sorry for the long text, hope it helped and clarified things.",""

I am sure it is tricky to code for, but I am willing to bet his big hit box initially covered for it, and taking it away revealed some difficult issues for whatever engine Blizzard uses to make multiplayer work. For instance, look at bug #4. The server has to take data on your position, reconcile that data with everyone elses position, and then feed it back to you with errors being corrected on your end. That miss looks like the result of your facing being changed by a very slight amount when the punch is launched. That can easily be explained by the server feeding back position data in conflict with where you are currently seeing while the punch is charging/released. The same argument could be made regarding the people who escaped stun. They likely hit the escape at the same moment the punch landed, but the server resolved in favor of them, where as a Rein would have had them locked in a charge.
