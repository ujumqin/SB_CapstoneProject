Blizzard Korea even publicly named hackers they banned in Overwatch for aimbotting.  Not the same I know but you get the idea...
https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20752619458,How do I know if someone I reported gets banned?,NA,"First, I'd suggest you remove the player's name, as name and shame is against the rules.Second, you can't tell whether the player you reported get banned or not.

https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20752619458,How do I know if someone I reported gets banned?,NA,"It would be quite unethical to do so, you reported it and blizzard is the neutral party between you, and the accused. Anything that happens beyond that point is entirely between the accused and blizzard. Apart from that I believe blizzard would not ban/punish for a single game where that occured, unless the person was using a hack that was registered by ingame detections as well, and that is a good thing as anyone can have a moment where their composure slipped and by murphy's law push to talk was on during that time. KYS is a stretch and sounds like something they would do on a regular basis if they have no qualms with saying that though. Therefore any reports from within the same game should probably count less than from 2 seperate instances. If that doesn't satisfy your vigilante nature, think of it this way: If they are cheating, toxic, or any other blizzard ""offense"", by the sheer amount of players that player encounters while playing if he is doing something wrong, he will get punished in due time."

https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20754915335,What Hero Would You Create?,NA,"I honestly don't know.  I made up so many classes but here's one that counters anti-flankers by having an ability that can pass through walls.  It's a personal skill and I thought about the ult giving her team wall pass through but it might be too OP.  If we look at maps like Hanamura, Eichenwalde, Anubis, Ilios, and Volksaya on top of heroes like Mei, Junkrat, Symmetra, and Torbjorn who can lock an entire lane by themselves.  Symmetra can load up a lane with turrets while Mei or Junkrat can spam down the other lane and choke and the problem here is it forces the attacking side to go through a bottleneck without much dodging space.  Sure Winston, D.Va, and Pharah can jump over but let's be real how often do people actually rush over the choke?  So this class is created out of a fundamental need.  I'm also working on a tank that would punch permanent customizeable lanes.  Due to being permanent there'd be a set amount of meters he could bore through during the entire match.  Symmetra would likely rig the new lane's exit so that would open up one of the original lanes for flankers anyway.   I included the backstory explaining the technology behind her.  I wanted them sufficiently advanced enough to barely pass for ""supernatural"".  Since she can fly and is hitscan (left click only, much less damage than Soldier) she can also dogfight with Pharah.  Just don't bring up Paladins they don't have a class that can get through walls and they don't even need one since flanks are numerous and wider generally and with far fewer mainway chokes.  Here's the art all the images tie in and the focus of the post is the pink fairy omnic. The big circle is the outside of the floating omnium where she's from and would be a PvE stage. http://imgur.com/a/6vNzeHeight: 46 Health: 125 with 65 sheilds and 60 normal health. Her tiny hitbox makes this low health balanced. Backstory: The flying omnium was created by a corrupted AI who was originally built to fight against omnics, but due to his superior mind was able to forge pico bots which are like nanobots but smaller and create his own faction thats opposed to both humans and the current omnics (the current omnics are defeated by the time the flying omnium becomes relevant in my alternative universe). Swarms of factory type pico bots form a fine cyan mist so it appears that these omnics come out of nowhere. They gather resources on Earth to bring back to the omnium and break them down at an atomic level to rebuild them into picobots, which are smaller than human cells and are like the cells of these new omnics, who seem more like half energy half metal based lifeforms instead of actual robots for that reason. However, one omnic that was constructed inherited the original creators intentions and gained awareness that they are doing wrong. She was ambushed by humans but boomerang girl saved her life. Now they protect the city together and are on the flying omniums hit list. Left shift: phase shift-her picobots spread giving her the ability to pass through walls. 14 second cool down, makes her hurtbox bigger but translucent while keeping the soft glow.  Totally immune to traps and constructions in this state and can still attack.  E: Launch- She simply launches into the air and glides but falls slightly faster than Mercy and has no rocket fuel. Launching close to nearby allies heals them for 100 health. Left click: hitscan lasers. Handles similar to Soldiers gun but is drastically weaker. A wand that shoots lasers. Right click: charges laser. This projectile based laser attack destroys projectiles, traps, and does small AoE damage (bonus damage to constructions) and healing.Ult: Since shes meant to counter anti flankers something along those lines without copying Sombras ult. She's a new kind of omnic that's much needed as she overcomes some of the game's flawed map design. Sym sets up turrets on a flank, Junkrat watches another, so now they're basically forced to go through a 10 foot wide door where getting hit with 6 people's spam is highly probable, so she'd help make one of the lanes safe for Genji and have a skill herself to pass through walls."

He now acts a bounty hunter, taking down any targets offered to him, his current ones being Junkrat and Roadhog, wanted for Junkrat's secret treasure found in the ruins of the Omnium.Appearance: As a junker Raptor has a very similar aethetic, with weapons and armor improvised from scraps found in Junkertown. Knife holster and charging port for the decoy drone can both be seen on his belt. When stowed the rifle can be seen slung over the shoulder. Also has the Crocodile Dundee hat, it just feels very fitting.Role: A scouting hero, the whole kit is based around finding and helping to take down enemy defenses. Meant to counter Torbjorn and Symmetra. Can also be helpful in dealing with a Pharah with his primary weapon.Health Pool: Standard 200 HPWeapon: A lever-action rifle with a two shot kill range of roughly 20 meters, but then an inifinte three shot kill range afterwards with a moderate fire rate. Holds 10 rounds per mag. Hitscan.Secondary Weapon: Swaps to a shank, this allows Raptor to run at roughly the speed of Soldier's sprint and melee faster dealing 40 damage. Mainly intended as a means of moving faster.Passive: Awareness: All enemy builables and traps can be seen through walls if you are within 10 meters of them for a brief period or if you or a teammate spots it directly. These stay marked until the buildable is either destroyed, triggered, or relocated.Ability 1: Decoy: Sends out a small drone which projects an identical decoy which will move around and mimic fire, dealing and taking no damage for 5 seconds. Can draw enemy turret fire. 6 Second CD starts once the decoy goes down.Ability 2: Marked: Callout a single enemy target, marking them with a chevron listing the hero name and an outline that is visible through walls. CD starts as soon as the abililty is used and lasts as long as the ability, duration and CD still undecided.Ult: (No name as of yet) Raptor loads in a magazine of six high power rounds, dealing 300 damage, but the shots are now projectile with a slower fire rate. Lasts until all rounds are fired or player reloads. If you reload without firing a shot then you'll have 50% ult charge refunded. Callout for Enemies/Self: ""This'll put ya' down!"" Callout for Allies: ""You'd best start runnin""Legenday Skin Ideas:Anzac: Inspired by the Australian WW1 soldiers, weilding a more standard looking rifle and knife. Really thought of this one because of Frederick Bishop in BF1, turnt up rim of the hat to boot. Additional Respawn line: ""I'm an aussie, we're impossible to kill.""Primal: As the name implies, this outfit carries a very primal look, sporting animal furs with a bear tooth worn around the neck. Rifle now made of wood and stone primarly with fur covering parts as well. The knife's blade now an animal claw.Achievement Ideas:That's Not A Knife (Pixel): Score three killing blows with the shank equipped in a single life.Happy Hunting (Cute): Get four eliminations with the ultimate."

Age: ??? Role: DefenseStory: Azimov Prototype 53 was really the first of its kind, having been created with seemingly some sort of consciousness, though perhaps this was more ingenious programming work. He was the last prototype created. Azimovs were created to be a peace-keeping unit for every household, designed to detain any intruders without harming them severely and altering authorities of intruders. This one served a dual purpose however, in also being a caretaker of the young son of the rich, polite couple that owned him. His defensive purpose made him an exceptional caretaker.Unfortunately there had been some sort of malfunction with most other earlier units causing them to become rather hostile. Production was shut down and they were all recalled to be destroyed and sold for scrap. Amazingly enough Azimov had avoided detection by disappearing into the sewers of London where he has lived for many, many years avoiding people and the wars that have taken place. Though all the time down there can lead to unfortunate circumstances. Not only has his mind become addled, many body parts are starting to fall apart.Recently he left the underground bunker of his home in search of a new purpose as he has lost a lot of his memories. His data has become rather corrupted, therefore giving him the nick-name of Fritz. I imagine him as a senile, friendly robot.Appearance: Rusted, archaic, past technology. His left leg and right arm have been replaced with scrapped metal he found around the sewers. Still wears his old top-hat, though it certainly has seen better days. He's got an open hole in his chest where his rats have built a nest to live inside him for protection.Abilities:Handgun: A 3-shot burst laser pistol given to Fritz by the family that owned him for self defense when he ran away to hide.Alarm Unit: He can deploy a small alarm bot that will let off a loud siren should anyone get nearby where it has been placed. It alerts other players to the location as well as lets off a small stun on the player(s) caught in its grasp. (So mini Infra-sight+Stun)Rat-pack: He can summon a small army of rats to attack people for a limited time. The rats, however, will seek out Turrets, Portals, Mines, Traps and kill them first before attacking people.Ultimate: Haywire- Sends out electrical waves from the hero for X Seconds, damaging and slowing all nearby enemy heroes.A few Voice Line Interactions:Fritz: ""Hey there short one, you look pretty good firing those bullets."" Tbjorjorn: ""What?"" Fritz: ""I wasn't talking to you, I was talking to gal beside you."" (I.E, the turret. He hits on the turret. I thought that would be rather amusing.Zenyatta: ""An azimov prototype? I'm amazed one of you survived so long."" Fritz: ""Aza-mawhatsit now? I have no idea what you're talking about floating fellow."" Zenyatta: ""Well, mostly survived.""Fritz: ""Lucio your music is pretty interesting, but nothing beats Sinatra."" Lucio: ""Frank Sinatra? That's pretty old school man."" Fritz: ""No no, my pet rat. He serenades me every night."" Lucio: ""Uh..sure thing.""Fritz: ""Bastion, come here can give your old uncle a hug!"" Bastion: ""Boo dee doo doo!"" Fritz: ""What do you mean I'm not your uncle!?""Bastion: ""Boo doo doo bee doop."" Fritz: *Laughs* ""Bastion, you tell the best jokes.""McRee: ""It's High Noon.""

Head of a group of bioingeneers, Warbeck studied the functionality of the human mind, and designed various patters of behaviour for his A.I. Using his cerebral implants, he created a perfect replica of his mind, and then programmed it to strategize for defense. Thus, Argus was born. The very first God Program. Argus, was meant to be the replacement of the English Nacional Security, but he went rogue, rebelling against his creator. It tried to merge his Mindcode with Warbeck's body, taking control of his cerebral implants, to create a perfect being, a human machine. But things didn't go as Argus planned. The assault left Warbeck in a state of crazed paranoia, with partial control over his own body, and very little memory of who he was before. He took the identity of Argus and left England, seeking aid. He asked the Cientist Council in Oasis for help, and in exchange he promised to oversee the Advanced Robotics Ministery. Nowadays he lives a recluse, a hermit in Oasis, crafting the worlds most advanced defense systems and dealing with his life as a dual entity.Abilities:Passive: Overshield. Argus has a shield around him that completely blocks damage dealt to him in the first 3s. Overshield regenerates after 20s of not taking damage.Primary Weapon (Left Click): Aegis Staff. Charges and then shoots a blast of electrical energy that travels on a straight line. Damage varies according to charge amount.Shield Drone (Right Click): Targets an ally hero and deploys a drone that grants Overshield, blocking all incoming damage for 3s. More that one drone can be active at a time, on different heroes. Drones last until destroyed. If the Overshield is destroyed, it will regenerate after 20s, providing the drone is still active.Cybershroud (Left Shift): Enters a shroud of electrical energy that grants him movement speed and does little damage to enemies around himRecon Droid (E ability): Summons a droid that guards a determinate area. When it comes in contact with an enemy hero, it links and reveals them. Lasts 10 seconds.Ultimate: Technosurge (Q): Enables weapon systems on deployed droids for 15s, also boosting Overshield duration and damage of Argus's basic abilities.Stats:- HP: 150- Movement speed:6 (meters/second)And here's mine!"

I really hate when YouTubers like Stylosa recommend this and people start parroting these ideas. I'm not saying you got it from a specific YouTuber, but I'm talking more generally. Role select is honestly not good. Role select will increase queue times, which are already very bad for Masters+ players. Role select will also make it annoying for people who like to flex and it will generally frustrate people. Not only that, role select generally doesn't make sense in Overwatch, because Symmetra is ""support"" and Roadhog is a ""tank"". This is also a problem because it's not always people want to run 2-2-2 perfect comps.

https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20758376822,Overwatch Needs a Role Select,7/30/2017 23:02,"This increasing trend of people not caring about the comp (regardless of game mode or meta) and just playing whatever they click on first is getting really tiresome.  Every single match I've played today, be it in the Game Browser, Arcade, or Quick Play, I've watched my entire team select everything but a tank or healer.  Oh, you might get the occasional D.va or Winston for tanks, but it's kinda pointless without a healer, especially when they're playing a very aggressive, ""Ain't Care"" style of play.The game really needs some kind of Role Select, even if it increases queue times.  I love sitting there for five to ten minutes waiting for a match, only to have no healer.  I 'main' a Mercy, but without a dedicated group, it can be frustrating to play with a bunch of rando's who really don't care about anything.  So I like to play different characters and work on my skills with a few of them (ideally I'd like to be proficient with at least one character from every role).But the last thing I want to do is heal a bunch of childish people who refuse to play as a team and work together.  It doesn't matter what mode you're playing in, it's still a team game, you still work together, and you still try to win.I think perhaps a role select at the top of the main menu screen where you could choose a Primary and Secondary role before being able to queue up for anything would be rather nice.  It'd let me pick, say, Support and Defense, or Support and Fill.  Something along those lines, perhaps in a similar vein to League of Legends.  Is this a perfect solution?  Probably not.  But something needs to be done about the selfish people ruining the match because supports and tanks are looked at as ""boring"" for some reason.  This isn't your typical FPS, and you shouldn't have that kind of mindset when coming in to play it."

Also allowing us to map some actions to a double-tap may work (like in CoD where double-tapping reload works as an instant C4 detonation).*Yes, X is reload, but if you press X by itself or with an unmapped button combo it'd still reload. I don't think it sounds dumb, sounds like a good idea. Edit: forgot to add, added it a day later."

It would stop all the Ultimate Farming off of Roadhog since you'd be forced to go face to face and get the round over with."

In fact, I'd actually argue it's better (slightly less max DPS, but loses accuracy less quickly). I think Bastion is just meant to be played differently now.  He should mostly be in recon mode, and only go into turret mode in certain specific situations (taking down shields and melting tanks, basically).  In other words, he now usually functions as a poor-man's Soldier (similar primary fire, but no helix rocket, a heal that prevents him from shooting, and a much larger hit box that is not fully compensated for by 100 extra armor), who also has the additional ability to melt shields and tanks better than Soldier can."

It's like comparing a heap of garbage to just a regular bag of garbage.Old Bastion had no survivability and no use. Recon mode was awful and sentry mode was also awful. Bastion never had a chance to heal because they would die too quickly before finding a spot to heal. The only thing objectively better about Bastion was their ultimate and their capability to kill close-ranged DPS.Current Bastion can actually attempt escapes now with faster transformations and healing on the go. Recon mode doesn't feel like Soldier 76 in a wheelchair and turret form is still capable of tearing through tanks and destroying barriers. Their ultimate is slightly worse, but it was already pretty bad to begin with. Effectively I feel like it's still in the same place because the slight change to their healthpool doesn't really mean anything in the grand scheme of things; Bastion is still going to instantly die the second one stun hits them and everyone looks at them.By far, current Bastion is on the right track. They just still need actual buffs and the dev team need to let Bastion actually try to stand on their two feet for awhile. I cannot to this day understand why they would nerf Bastion two days after launch so significantly. Literally no one on live had time to adapt before it was decided ""actually it's unfair that Bastion can 1v1 some heroes sometimes if they set up in the right place, time to nerf them."""

Time has nothing to balance. Blizz is just lazy or they have no idea what are they doing. Doomfist hitbox as exmaple, it is hard to fix it ? Hell no, did they fixed it ? NO. Why ? Not enough time ?

Please Watchhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kDqZ_dsZAQ________Recently purchased a amazing new Ultrawide monitor however I've since learned that Overwatch does not support true 21:9 aspect ratio and instead crops the game to fit which actually ends up showing less than normal 16:9. Apparently Blizzard says it would be unfair and thus has implemented this janky version instead. Why are you crippling Ultrawide users by showing them less than 16:9 I'm baffled. I'm here to beg Blizzard to please reconsider. The real argument at hand here is if Blizzard is concerned about competitive play then why is no one discussing the other things that also give advantages like console users being able to play with mouse and keyboard or people with better internet giving them lower latency or monitor refresh rates giving better accuracy and smoothness. Why is that the people who have decided to upgrade their hardware to Ultrawides must chose whether or not to play with black bars or this severely cropped version. I find it rather baffling that every major title that has been release in the last 10 years has support for true 21:9 resolutions including other competitive shooters and mobas like CS:GO or HOTS yet somehow it's not okay in Overwatch. What makes Overwatch different from other competitive shooters that 21:9 is not okay here but okay everywhere else? What about Destiny 2 that just came out, I've been playing it and it looks amazing because it supports the real aspect ratio and is not cropped; even the pre-rendered cutscenes are in true 21:9 which I commend Bungie for because even games like Witcher3 give black boarders during cutscenes. The reality is that casuals players like myself simply just want to play the game and have fun and basically telling us that our hardware is unfair is silly. We aren't going to competitive offline tournaments where 16:9 is the standard so what is the big deal here? No one wants to play with black bars on their screen when every other game in the world including all other competitive shooters support real 21:9.

https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759356748,[Uncapped Mei-gathread] A new hope for Mei...,NA,"Mei is in dire need of a small buff, because right now is she somewhat underpowered in the current character roster.The thing is that she doesn't need much to become more viable.One of her unique core abilities is freezing enemies. This is what needs to be adjusted.Jumping delays it and most heroes have the abilities to escape it.(See a few post above this.)I'm not saying that enemies shouldn't be able to escape it, but Mei should at least have the upper hand in a close battle, because she can't attack multiple enemies at once nor can't she attack enemies from far away.Make her primary fire a hitscan, give her primary fire a larger spread, allow her to freeze multiple enemies at once or make her freeze enemies faster, even with her ult.Just one of these suggestions would be enough to make her slightly more viable.She's a tank/DPS hybrid. Her purpose is to stall points and act as an anti-flanker/anti-mobility. Right now is she only good for stalling points.If Mercy got reworked because hiding and rezzing wasn't fun, Dva got reworked because she was a DM bot, Roadhog got changed because his OHK wasn't fun, then why is Mei, who is primarily used for stalling, fine? If she is only used for stalling then she isn't fun as well, right?"

Also for AMD video card users, the new driver fixed the random crashes, so you can record you awesome pentakill with a blizzard and you best actions. Also Mei seems to be more powerful on PTR, i'm not sure...I want to thank you all the players who contributed to this thread, who contributed to the discussion with valid reasons and arguments, and who contributed with an upvote, and thank a lot especially these players who helped me and contributed to make better this thread in these months: BloggermanJinxedXodiaKWhyAlwaysMeMoonBurstPurpheratedMackGhostofKafkaDestianApollo7GmanBut the work is not finished yet: if Mei will be buffed, be prepared to defend the buffs from the whiners who will ask for an unneded nerf without a specific reason, with all the valid arguments we achivedI'm going to recap here the problems and the possible solution i found with the help other players:Major problems:Primary Fire (aka Frost Stream):This ability has been created to counter mobility and flankers, but ot of heroes can escape her freeze ray in a lot of ways (i reposted the ways to escape)It bends a lot, making her work nearly impossible when you try to freeze someoneCryofreeze:Enemies tend to camp near her or they place structures to make Mei's healing attempt uselessBefore the ability starts, there is a little delay between the animation and the ability, and this allows enemies to kill you, this is known as ""Cryofreeze favoring the shooter""Ana and Moira's orbs can't heal Mei during the cryo-freeze (instead Mercy, Lucio and Zenyatta can).This ability is abused for stallingBlizzard(the ultimate, not the company :P)It needs 2.5 seconds to freeze, but a lot of heroes can escape Mei's ultimate easily. It's used more to prevent enemies to get on the objective.When you get killed, stunned, hooked or sleep-darted, now the ultimate doesn't refundMinor problems:Icicles:They are the only projectiles affected by damage decayThe minimum damage they can do is 22 (because of the damage decay), and compared to other heroes, this is not really muchIce wall:Allies can't see where are you going to place the wall, and this can make them frustrated easily, and this favors the trolling(These are some ways proposed by me and other players to make her more viable)Buff suggestions:Frost stream:Now it decreases the effect of ""special movement"" abilities (like double jumps, run, and similar abilities), initial debuff effect from 10% that increases up to 25%Now affects vertical movements tooFrozen shields will take (20%) more damageSpeed has been increased to 30 m/sThis adjustment will make her primary mechanic more effective, punishes players that tries to engage Mei closely and makes her able to give teammates an occasion to destroy a shield.Cryofreeze:Now automatically reloads her weapon similar to Wraith FormAna and Moira's orbs now can heal Mei in cryofreezeNow Mei will be ready to fight again, and will be able to be healed by other healers. Blizzard:When you are killed, stunned, sleep-darted or hooked, Snowball (the drone) continues to go as a grenade and get activatedIt decreases enemies's movement abilities effect as the primary fire, but up to 45% this timeThe cast time should be reduced/removed. Mei can lose the ultimate when the drone is in her hand and not while it's out of her hand and it's going to landNow the ultimate can be used as an area denial and crowd control tool. It will punish poor enemy positioning more often, and will reward players that can escapeIciclesThe damage falloff should be reduced (minimum range or damage increased)Ice wallNow allied can see the aura of where the wall will be spawned (proposed by XodiaK)It's slippery for enemies: if a Genji tries to climb it, a Widowmaker tries to grapple or a Lucio tries to wallride on it, they will fall. This will make rage less the teammates because they will know where the wall will be (useful also for players without a microphone). Probably this will discourage the trolling. Also will make it a better defense tool.Netcode/latenciesWhen Mei enters in cryofreeze it actives without the possibility to be hooked/stunned/killed and she starts to heal herselfWhen the wall spawns bullets can't trepass itThis will make Mei more viable and less frustrating to play, with these issues fixed and with a better netcodeBug and issues:Check the Reddit threads i linked, there are listed all Mei bugs with proofsTL;DRMei at the moment she's inefficient compared to other heroesShe needs bug fixes,QoL fixes/adjustments and few buffsA lot of heroes can escape her freeze ray and her ultimate.She got a lot of unfixed bugs(Sorry for the wall of text.)"

I'm sure the devs read the forums, certainly not daily, but the only evidence that they read our comments is little tidbits like this that come months after the problem has been caught by the playerbase, and that isn't okay. Look at all of the Mercy mega-threads. 7000 comments over 3 different threads, and not one response to any of the comments or suggestions. There have been at least 2 Doomfist Mega threads of about a thousand each, and only after someone called out Jeff on not paying attention to Doomfist, and two incredibly detailed bug posts after almost 6 months of being useless does he start getting addressed.Theres a Symmetra thread with 2000 comments on the front page, and any acknowledgement to that would be wonderful.I'm glad Mei is finally getting recognized.

Fixing her known bugs, which cripple her playstyle.2) Frost stream: make her left-click hitscan, and delete the total freeze effect. Replace it with a bigger slow effect (that lingers for a bit) and disables movement abilities after 0.8 sec (to give them time to get out if they react fast enough). This gives her a true role of anti-flanker. A bit of extra damage would be appreciated as well.3) increase the minimum damage on her right click (max range) to 35/40.4) Ice wall: add an extra pillar for more versatility. Add an indicator for the allied teamembers as well.5) cryo-freeze: cut the time in the ice-block to 3 sec, and increase her healing accordingly. Make her reload her gun over time in cryo-freeze.6) Blizzard: make the thrown ultimate act like a grenade and activate regardless of mei's life. Make the ult freeze a tad faster as well.

Mostly because of all the delays, and the early audio queue.I already know it's not plausible to throw it at your feet in a crowd, but that's the most effective way to reduce the startup delay, to it's minimum of 1.5 seconds. Even then, it's not guaranteed that anyone within arm's length of Mei will get frozen.Ah, ok I see what you mean."

I would like to write to you today to discuss the current state of Junkrat's ability commonly referred to as ""RIP-Tire."" This ability is regarded as one of the most unbalanced and not fun abilities to play against. There are several reasons for this. One being that the tire moves incredibily quickly and can turn on a dime. This makes it basically luck to hit with projectiles and extremely hard to hit with hitscan, even among the top level. Also, junkrat builds his tire extremely quickly, which is not good for an ability which is considered overpowered or good. For example, Zarya's ultimate ability known as ""Graviton Surge,"" builds slowly because of how powerful it is. Lastly, an issue not brought up often but is very important in my personal opinion is that tire can ride along roofs. This is very broken because the tire can LOS(Line of Sight) the players and gives it plenty of cover. In addition, when it rides along the roof, it is silent and you do not hear the engine of the tire like you would when it is riding along the ground. I hope you guys take these points into consideration and make some changes to the ultimate ability. Thank you for reading Activision Blizzard : )EDIT: One final piece of feedback I forgot about Junkrat RIP-Tire is the range of the explosion.

About the negation of ultimates,a widow or hanzo can stop most of the ultimates in game with one shot, where the ult caster will die of it, not so for junk, so i would not consider this a valuable argumentation.The ult is the main problem.

More than anything it's to shed light on the issues that Symmetra is facing and how she's becoming obsolete with the evolving nature of the game. These ideas are the kind of ideas Symmetra players wonder about when they think of ""viability"" in the sense that other characters have that fall under the category of support, without boxing her into something as arbitrary as a healer. I've tried to limit the amount of ""reworking"" suggestions in this thread, but at this point, I'm leaning more towards it due to her place in the evolving nature of the game and competitive team comps. If you have an idea you feel is within her playstyle and will bring her viability, please list it in this forum. Ideas that have been thrown out:(Kyleesie Ideas)New Features to Existing Abilities:Photon BarrierChange the shape of the barrier into a sphere so it can block damage from all angles, and fully protect someone running with it.Health readuced to 900 down from 1025.- OR -Provides 75 shields to any ally it comes into contact with. The shields decay slowly 3 seconds after leaving a 5 meter radius of the Turret projecting the barrierReddit Idea:Let her place supportive turrets.(The issue with this is its not as flexible as other support utility and is too area based. Which in the end would cause the same potential problems as before)My idea:Her Glove as a Secondary weapon, similar to torb and mercy, unlocks a new ability under the primary fire of this ""weapon"": Photon Shield (yes, bring it back)Channeled ability, resource meter of 12-15 seconds. 30 Yard range. Grants 40 barrier health to your target per second. Can give up to 50 extra health. When not channeling, will degenerate at a rate of 5 hp per second. Barrier health is the same mechanic used in sound barrier and doomfists passive, which is why I suggest using this mechanic as a ""psuedo-heal"". This would grant her a place in the game as the only support counter available to Ana's grenade. She'll still primary play as a defensive dps, but this will give her defensive support utility that helps sustain the team and the main healer, without actually making her a healer. The way that barrier health functions, it would work somewhere between healing and the original photon shield. That is, that instead of providing a flat hp bonus, it would give a max of 50 ""bonus health"", but since it's barrier health, any missing HP would have to be filled with Symmetra's resource meter degenerating barrier health (like doomfist) before the ""bonus"" hp would apply.These suggestions, or variations of it, are the most popular on the forums. Id even be willing to have her gun range nerfed, as lower SR seems to hate it, in exchange for more utility.Basically the same as her old ability, but not a flat hp bonus. Since its barrier health, missing hp has to be given before giving the bonus.Lastly, this is a quote that I really like from one of the other very well thought out Symmetra threads (Kyleesie's thread) that I really enjoyed.  This basically sums up opinion on why on why it may be necessary to give her a ""pseudo-heal""/stronger damage mitigation, while staying true to the developers vision for her. You don't need to make her a healer! That's the beauty of it. You just need to make her sustain to the point the team doesn't miss an offhealer :)Comments: I know the developers intentionally designed Sym without any traditional healing. However, while I respect their philosophy to design a unique way for her to function as a support, I strongly feel that her inability to heal (especially while classified as a ""support"" hero) negatively affects how players perceive her in the game. Simply put, Symmetra confuses people. New players are unsure of what she is used for, and veteran competitive and pro players don't value her utility over other support heroes who can actually heal. As a result, Symmetra is stifled by negative opinions, and those who choose to play her receive an egregious and unfair amount of toxicity and blame.Ideas added later based on discussions within the thread:Mohock Ideas: Letting her be stronger anti-mobility by having turrets affect things such as Dash/Blink, allowing her to set the base of her ultimate in a predetermined location before she gets it.Crestren Ideas: Allowing her to have more buildables, such as bridges, elevators, or structures that grant support to the team.Dr.Fate Idea:: Symmetra is granted a passive that gives sustain, similar to Lucio but exclusively affecting shield HP pools."
https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759380928,[MEGATHREAD-UNCAPPED] Symmetras place in the game,NA,"Here are some of my potential ideas that could improve her kit and make her more viable:Turret-Survivability:Give her turrets thermoptic camo like Sombras. The turret stays invisible until an enemy comes in reach, decloaks and shoots. After a few seconds out of combat they recloak again. This would allow for more flexible and creative traps and prevents Tracer/DVa/Reaper from shootgunsniping them across the map.Turret-Placement: Give her turrets the flying behavior like the shieldcore, but instead of getting destroyed by hitting a surface, the turret sticks to it. This would solve the immobility issue while placing them, they could be used to contest high ground more effective and they would be more viable to push a point. Bonus buff if they would start fireing midflight.Turret-Slowing: Slowing effects from the turrets (or Mei) could be applied to ""teleport""-abilities like Tracers Blink or Genjis Dash, resulting in a shortening of the traveling distance equivalent of the percentage the hero is slowed down. A 25% Movement speed reduction from one turret would lead to a 10,5m dash instead of 14m.Ultimates: Let her place the base plate of her ultimates in advance even with 0% on her ultcharge and activate them when they are ready. You would set up the base with Q and could change the placement at any time by building a new one in case you change your mind or they get destroyed. I would even disable their shields until they are activated so flankers could dispose of them quickly if discovered. Pressing Q with 100% ultcharge would bring up the same image as of now of the sg/tp and you can select to activate the existing base by looking up or build a new one by looking down towards the ground. This way, Symmetra players don't have to leave the battle for prolonged times to set up her ults at a good spot and they can be activated right as the fight breaks loose to get a better impact."

Up to two of these orbs can exist at once.

It also helps alleviate mobility to non mobile heroes (like Ana, Zen, Mei) so she can play a role in that and help her team move around better. And it does fit as it provides another utility to help support her team as shes not a healer type, she supports her team with her utility."
https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759380928,[MEGATHREAD-UNCAPPED] Symmetras place in the game,NA,"I've played Sym for over 200 hours and she's carried me from about 1700 to about 60 points away from Diamond. One suggestion I've had for a while is to add a simple 1HP barrier to her turrets, as a barrier will always absorb the impact from blow no matter how much it does. This would prevent them from being destroyed by something like D.Va's ult, Rein charge, Genji's Swift Strike, Lucio's Boop, Junkrat's Concussion Mine, etc. It gives Symmetra more staying power because there are less ways to counter her turrets, which are her main mode of support, but they still only effectively have 2HP so any automatic weapon fire can still dispose of them quickly.Another is that Symmetra just needs to take less time to do things across the board. She takes too long to deploy turrets, which then also have to activate so around 2 seconds from deployment to activation time for a turret which makes her harder to use on attack since she needs so much setup time. Her photon barrier needs to deploy earlier in the animation and closer to Symmetra, there are so many times where I have perfectly timed a block only to have the Hook/Flashbang/Widow Headshot go through it and then the barrier floats away from my corpse.I also think an interesting buff would be to either have her alt fire charge faster or move faster. She has the only basic attack that goes through barriers at range and, while useful in its current state, can sum up to poke damage if they have two healers. I think allowing it to either move or charge faster would give Symmetra a better chance on attack as she would be able to deal massive, unforgiving amounts of damage to the enemy team. These are mostly just QoL suggestions, as far as I'm concerned. The only straight buff is the charge or movement speed, and I think that's pretty minor tbh. The only serious kit alteration I could think would be to re-add back the photon shield at 25 and let her stack that with her shield generator, with the caveat that the 25 shields disappear if she dies. That would allow Symmetra to have a somewhat better impact before she's able to get an ultimate up, but can be punished if she were to die."

In turn, it was like he didn't do anything, even though he was working extra hard with his limited kit.Imagine if an entire character's kit was similar to Zarya's grav in the sense that it needs friendly follow up to actually do anything?

A sphere photon shield does little to support her kills with the low range of her gun, while it does help her team move forward.

Blizzcon Q&amp;A:Any plans to make Symmetra more viable in competitive? Maybe healing abilities?Symmetra doesn't really fit well in the support category, but doesn't fit in defense either. In the future we might need to revist the categories to better accomodate changes with the game.Symmetra doesn't see much play in high competitive, but her recent toolkit change brought some interesting changes that made her more viable.Please, please, developers. Its obvious you listen to us, otherwise a Talon Healer wouldnt have been the next hero despite the massive demand for her. The community obviously wants her to be more supportive. Recategorizing her will not fix her fundamental issues when there are currently better, more intuitive options in the game for her niche (junkrat), as well as more supportive options for her niche coming as well (moira).From the Patch concerning her rework:""We wanted to address two main issues with Symmetra. First, on the whole, we felt that she didnt feel active enough. Second, due to the nature of her Teleporter, she felt weak in certain situations on different maps and game modesTo address the first point, we replaced her more passive Photon Shield ability with a much more active ability: Photon Barrier. Now, Symmetra can help lead the charge on offense or help shut down a big push on defense by actively blocking damage for your team. For the second point, we noticed players would often switch off of Symmetra once they found themselves in a situation where her Teleporter wasnt as useful. For example, when playing her on defense on an Assault map, players often used her to defend the first capture point, then quickly switched to another hero if that point fell. To help her feel more useful in more situations, we've given her an alternative to her Teleporter. The Shield Generator is just as important for the enemy to deal with, but is useful in more situations. .""This is important to note, as she is the most passive support out of all 5, and she is also the most situational. She is not viable on attack, as the intention of the rework. The first rework failed its intended purpose.You can read through this or skim to the bolded sections. While a lot of people argue that Symmetra is strong within her niche. That is precisely the issue with her. When she was most viable was within her Niche on chokes such as Hanamura, Eichenwalde, and Volksaya defense. There were numerous complaints on how hard chokes were to break through, so developers made several balancing adjustments, both to the maps, and characters who had either abilities or mobility to deal with the chokes. From that point onwards,  new map development gave a lot of alternative pathways and elevation that lessened her Niche's effectiveness and gave numerous easy options for counterplay, not to mention shes not very viable outside of her niche, either.The point? The newest maps, newest characters, and newest buffs to heroes mean that her original Niche is shrinking, and her viability outside that niche is dismal if not compromising to the team. AKA: Shes not relevant to the current version of the game.The elephant in the room: She is the utility support, however, she is the only support whose utility mechanics are not readily available for use (speed, discord, damage boost) while the other support who has utility on cooldown has two highly active, flexible utility abilities that have a variety of uses that outclass Photon Barrier, and have less counters than her turrets do.  The other issue is that all of these support alternatives not only have better utility in their actual kit (not taking into account ultimates), but all the other support utility is in conjunction to healing. She was designed as a damage mitigating, utility support, that defends the backlines; however, almost all of the support in her kit comes from her ultimate, which makes her the only character who is balanced entirely around the merit of her ultimate- which is one of her design flaws, if this patch from Blizzard is any indication:Game-changing ultimate abilities were coming up a bit too frequently. This change helps keep them in check while still allowing them to be powerful. (universal nerf to ultimate charge)If a character is balanced around an ultimate, then it is likely that their kit is lacking. Symmetra has the lowest ultimate costs in the game, and can keep her ultimate up indefinitely. This should raise concerns as to what part of her kit makes this necessary in her design. They wanted her to more engaging in the rework, with more of a capacity for proactive and reactive engagement, but her kit has most of the most passive abilities in the game. Also important to note, if all of her her supportive merit is funneled into her destructible ultimates, she will always lose to Zen/Lucio, who dont need their ultimate or to keep a structure alive to be supportive. Not only that, but her supportive capacity was originally her E, which rightly means that her original design did not involve a passive ultimate to provide support.Please, complete her kit. We know this is something youre capable of doing. Within the last month, you completed Mercys kit due to the feedback of DPS mains. This is feedback from the people who play the character. Please fix her.She doesnt  NEED  to heal, but she suffers from an incomplete kit as a support character. (if you need proof she's a support) Luminums videos show her potential as a support, but watching his videos often makes it clear to me that her kit is just not as cohesive as the other characters in the game, even the defense characters which skeptics seem to be convinced she is. His best plays are supportive plays, so she obviously has potential as a support. She just plays more like an offensive support, similar to Zen.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1GvmBQk8-shttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flWwBFCTjsUhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBbe7ylCy18(this was patched but shows how he needs high game sense, and to be innovative to a crazy level to succeed with her limited kit) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sJwuH1BMwY(this video shows the potential of team flanks at 4:10) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YhsywtY2OM(and this video shows why symmetra falls short as a support she needs her team to support her for her to support them. Shes more follow-through dependent than any other support because she lacks support in her actual kit, but people will troll you because they see you as a troll pick) He makes great plays, saving his team from reinhardt ultimates, making team flanks, etc. But really, while thats amazing, theres not much he can do inbetween that except try to make picks. While other offsupports like lucio/zen, have their utility up (speed/discord) in addition to no cooldown, no ultimate options for heals (heal aura/harmony orb).Quality of Life adjustments for Symmetra are necessary, but if that is all she receives, she likely won't have a place in the game as the game evolves.The best, and most commonly suggested Quality of Life suggestions are:Turrets: Reduce the delay in placing and ""activating"" the turrets after you deploy them, as well as remove the slow that Symmetra is afflicted with when placing them.Ultimates: Let them be seen through walls for teammates, as well as willful deconstruction of her barrier generator so a skilled Symmetra can change her nesting location, similarly to how a widowmaker will change her sniping location. Let her deconstruct her teleporter to redeem some of her ult charge if the charges are running low. Also, allow her to build her ultimates on walls and ceilings at slightly longer range, so her setups become less predictable.(via AConstelle) Remove the 5-6 second delay she has on gaining ult when her Shield Generator is destroyed. The delay isn't there for TP, but it is for Shield Gen for some reason, and 6 seconds is a lot of time for Sym. Also the blue line indicating the Shield Gen's radius would be swell.Photon Barrier: There have been numerous suggestions for this ability. Increase the charges on it, decrease the cooldown, give her more control over it. The biggest consistent complaint I've seen with this ability is the fact that Symmetra has a harder time contributing with this support utility than other supports have contributing with their utility that is often on a lower cooldown or does not have a cooldown while simultaneously being easier skills to contribute with. This ability needs to be able to compete with an offhealing slot, period. Its her only active support ability. The other point I want to bring up is that she is the only support who has a viable alternative to rez, which a lot of people are concerned about.[Moderator edit - I removed the direct call-out to the Dev team.  The Feedback here is greatly appreciated but the idea of the forums is a discussion among players.  The Dev team has access to the discussion and may take part in the discussion but the main focus is the discussion.  Not shutting this down just trying to redirect the focus :) ]"

If they give her healing, she'll instantly become viable.If they do the rest of my suggestion, she should be some where between a tank, dps, and defense. Giving her team more flexibility on deciding if they want to got single healer, tank, or dps, without outright hurting the effectiveness of the team."

The character has worst rep. 0% play-rate at tournaments. Generates most toxicity of any character in the game for both enemy and team. Faces weekly posts &amp; complaints at lower-level of matchmaking. Edit:They should consider the glove idea and barrier idea. If you can make symmetra more proactive. you will instantly resolve 80% of her troll-pick status if it is implemented intelligently. you will also increase her versatility ten-fold.

That cant be that hard to change.I don't think that's at all true. Let's say that they want to improve on their original design of a support Symmetra. They just need to improve her damage mitigation, right now, there's only sound barrier, Zarya barriers, armor packs, shield gen, and actual barriers. This leaves them a ton of room for creativity in regards to giving her something fresh and in her playstyle.They had Lucio, zen, Ana, and mercy healing and they still made Moira which feels distinct and unique. If you think they couldn't buff Symmetra in a way that feels distinctly ""Symmetra"" you're not giving them enough credit."

I made this thread to let our voices with regards to our platform of the game be heard.Consoles have more convenience in them, and the vast majority of us have friends that play on Console, not on PC. We're not blind in this community. Look at threads that get a reply from devs in this forum (not to be confused with mods here). How many of those threads are PC related, and something small (i.e. when new cosmetics are coming)? Sure, it's not many, but it still has the better reply chance. Now look at the other end: the threads that are Console related, and something well researched/documented. How many of these kinds of threads get a reply from devs? Practically none.To answer your last bit: yes I already do have a job. The reason why I don't go and buy more games is because:1. It's made by a company who is known to have greedy business practices (I'm looking at you EA, main Activision (so as not to be confused with Blizzard Entertainment), and Ubisoft, to name a few). 2. Overwatch is still better than quite a lot of games that were made even this year (even despite what it lacks on Console). If I come off as somebody who sounds easily tilted, that may very much be the case (I won't deny it). However, not only did we still pay for the game, but a good chunk of the things that we've been wanting/needing, we've been asking since launch (that's almost 19 months ago now). We still are as passionate as you guys on PC are about this game. We aren't even asking for a lot with threads like this one, and Biv's (linked in OP), to name a couple. We don't even get something as simple as ""Hey guys, we hear you loud and clear!"" on these forums, even despite all of our concerns. Yet, there's threads that ask when new cosmetics are coming that get answered within a few hours, and in some cases, even as little as 15 minutes. Look at how long we had to wait for our Report System (and this is just to name one example). We didn't even get a reply about when our Report System would be coming until 8 months after the game launched (this was when they hoped to have it in during, or even before summer, you see). When we had asked for an update in July, we get the response of ""Soon"" (again, you know what I'm implying). Now you have 14 months past launch and it's still not in the Console version of the game. The Report Feature was not enabled for us until the 1.14 patch, which released on August 28th. That's 15 months gone that we've had to deal with being unable to report glitchers, throwers, etc.. I'm not going to so much use the term cheaters in this bit; a vast majority of the cheating that had occurred on Console were people glitching into walls to be able to prevent point caps making it impossible for the attacking team to cap their objective. So we had people that could get away with literally anything and everything and we wouldn't be able to do anything about it.You also can't justify the excuse of ""It's because of Sony/Microsoft"" either. Games that have been available on Console have already had a Report System available on day 1. Heck, Fortnite is still in beta, and it already has a Report System. Hope I've cleared up some of our situation to you. Apologies if I've sounded critical on some parts. As I stated though, we are still passionate about this game just as much as you guys are.What are you not getting?!?I was not talking to you. My post was to someone else.

Ana deserves PotG for nano'ing someone at just the right time and healing people; Mercy deserves it if she rezzes the two people and dmg boosts their ults that result in a team wipe, Lucio deserves it for a perfectly timed sound barrier and a boop; Sym deserves it for her turrets killing someone on point while she saves her tele/shield gen from someone; Moria deserves it from healing her entire team with her ult; Zenny deserves one for discording and killing someone and interrupting their ult, or preventing someone's ult from killing everyone. Rein deserves one for protecting his team from an ult storm with his shield; same with Orisa. Winston deserves one for a perfect bubble &amp; kill combo, or a nice killstreak with his ult. And Zarya deserves it for bubbling the right person at the right time and/or ulting and allowing other people to get a team wipe.But you almost never see any of this, because PotGs generally go to Offense/Defense heroes, even if it's not truly deserved."

(my personal big issue with this)*Possible solution to this-pause respawn timer/prevent it from going out while Mercy is resurrecting target player-reset Mercy's resurrect if target player respawns before resurrect takes effect2) The non-reset to GA when ulting is dandy. No problems have been had (by me at least.)3) The Movement speed reduction seems sorta harsh, and if the patch notes truly didn't mention it then that's a problem, but my experience with it as of this time is neutral."

I'll explain you what's going on with this matter, why it is stupid to be implemented and what it is in first place.Bunny hop has nothing to do with a mere spam space. It was essentially a glitch in counter strike where the character's velocity was increasing if you were strafe jumping in certain patterns. Strafe jumping can be observed with soldier, while sprinting and lucio. However, if you were pressing space again in a specific momentum, your character wasn't losing his velocity, which had as a result to increase continuously your speed. As the speed increases, it becomes more difficult to control your momentum in both strafes and jumps, so eventually you fail. That was bunny hop.It was forbidden to be used in tournaments for long time, since it messed around with the engagement timings. In short there was a high distortion in time (you didn't know when an enemy 1 mile away will eventually come to you). After many years, they decided to allow bunny hopping as it became a common practice in unofficial games and tournaments, but they forbidden the use of mouse scroll as jump.Except acceleration and time distortion, there was another use of bunny hop. They used to bunny hop to entry and become more difficult targets to snipers. However, there's a huge difference here. In Counter Strike there was different dmg if you hit an arm, a leg or body. Snipers there have only 1 bullet at the time, and they one shot body and head, while you will not be killed if you are hit on the leg. This does not occur in Overwatch. Furthermore, overwatch heroes can aim while in the air, while counter strike characters are penalized. Therefore, bunnyhopping there, gives you high mobility with the drawback of not being able to hit.It's not easy to hit someone who bunny hops properly, even for a master... However who cares about ""hitting properly"" in overwatch? Just smash his legs and he takes the same dmg. Also, there's no such a thing as predictable bunnyhopping because velocity increases, but not linearly. It depends on the strafe at the given jump."

So you end up gliding out to the point and getting killed by an enemy you can't see.Mystery Heroes is the worst culprit at this as every game usually starts with the invisible heroes, except the pre-match countdown allows enough time for the heroes to render.POTGs are also broken in this way.

Do you even try to counter the hero? do you work with your team to defeat him? you keep trying the same thing over and over again?1.- Junkrat counters bad coordination easily, if your team keeps going in the exact same place Junkrat is spamming your team is just gonna receive severe dmg if not die. 2.- If junkrat jumps on your tank and kill it, its entirely your teams fault for not killing him, he puts himself at high risk and you guys just ignore him leading to the dead of your tank.3.- Self dmg was removed because it was a huge drawback to him, Junkrat is suppose to dominate at close range and having the self dmg didnt allow that, people actually (Especially tanks) used to just walk towards him to make himself receive dmg and then just kill him easily. -- The Pharah comparison doesnt make sense if you are at range to dmg yourself     has Pharah is your fault.4.- If you wanna kill him DONT fight him at close range always keep your distance, at long range he basically cant dmg you, at medium range you just have to evade his nades and the mine since is slow is pretty inefficient at medium range. (i win against him most of the time thanks to this) -- You could also try to flank him, his hitbox is pretty big (just like Zens) making     him a easy kill if you jump on him5.- Junkrat CANT one-shot without his Rip-Tire or the help of Zen or Mercy (And even with their help he can only oneshot Tracer and D.va unless both are helping him) 6.-  The double mine thing... he is wasting his mines if he killed you using both, he just used his tools to escape making him an easy kill. (And again dont try to fight him at close range) 7.- Im sure someone if gonna come up with this, Junkrat was trash before his buffs i keep hearing people saying that he shouldnt had got any buff. Im sure some of them they didnt even play him way back then.The Most important thing Im sure that im speaking for over 80% of the Junkrat mains that... We all agree with a charge rate nerf on the Rip-Tire we know it charge fast but the rest of his kit is fine as it is. And i know the reason of this because when he got his double mine and the tire buff, the devs didnt put in consideration the charge rate, Pre-buff Junkrat was to inconsistent but now that he is, he can charge his tire easier and faster thats what they overlook."

You're just saying that because he did something risky, he isn't OP just because it worked out.

Since Junkrat can deal (at most) 460 damge in one second (assuming there are two mines thrown, the enemy is trapped, and he hits with one grenade), it's reasonable to say that's a little ridiculous.Posted by DarkCat3.- Self dmg was removed because it was a huge drawback to him, Junkrat is suppose to dominate at close range and having the self dmg didnt allow that, people actually (Especially tanks) used to just walk towards him to make himself receive dmg and then just kill him easily. Yeah self damage is to make sure you can't just run in and guarantee you do 120 damage every single shot. Having a guaranteed 120 DPS is ridiculous, frankly. Self damage existed so that explosion based characters would have to keep their range, meaning that you could theoretically kill them with a well timed shield or body block. Posted by DarkCatThe Pharah comparison doesnt make sense if you are at range to dmg yourself has Pharah is your fault.A comparison to Pharah is valid. If you're saying the reason Junkrat would die to self damage was because people would rush him, then that also applies to Pharah. People can rush Pharah down and make her kill herself on self damage. Range is irrelevant, we're talking about rushing someone down.Posted by DarkCat4.- If you wanna kill him DONT fight him at close range always keep your distance, at long range he basically cant dmg you, at medium range you just have to evade his nades and the mine since is slow is pretty inefficient at medium range. (i win against him most of the time thanks to this)In a strictly 1v1 scenario, sure. That'd work. But, in a team game, if your team is working together you won't be able to get that sightline on Junkrat because his team will take you out. You're not wrong, technically, but it's a moot point because it isn't a 1v1 situation.Posted by DarkCat5.- Junkrat CANT one-shot without his Rip-Tire or the help of Zen or Mercy (And even with their help he can only oneshot Tracer and D.va unless both are helping him)No one can one-shot unless it's Hanzo or Widow. That's a moot point.And he can effectively oneshot any hero below 340 HP (trap + 2 mines). Think the hook combo, while that wasn't technically a oneshot, it sure felt one.Posted by DarkCat6.- The double mine thing... he is wasting his mines if he killed you using both, he just used his tools to escape making him an easy kill.It won't matter if he has no escape after he's killed you, because in this scenario, it's a 1v1. If he's in the middle of your team, then his Total Mayhem means that he's still denying an area even though he died. There isn't a negative to that scenario. He either gets a pick and gets away, or he trades and denies area. No downside.Posted by DarkCat7.- Im sure someone if gonna come up with this, Junkrat was trash before his buffs i keep hearing people saying that he shouldnt had got any buff. Im sure some of them they didnt even play him way back then.I used to play Junkrat a lot. He always felt fine. I like his 2 mine change, but the self damage thing is kinda stupid. The self damage is pretty much the biggest problem with Junkrat imo."

https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760626703,To the Junkrat NERF posts,NA,"This is a post I made in an another thread about his pickrate/winrate. I'll just c/p it here since it's relevantJunkrat start with 7.76% pickrate and go dow to 3.29% in GM, where his winrate goes to  47.42% to 57.76% in GMSymmetra starts with 2.05% pickrate and goes down to 0.86% in GM, where her winrate stays consistently at the average 59%, except on bronze, which is 56%,and as equal, torbjorn goes to 1.73% to 0.51% , and 52.96% to 56%, an average across all the ranks.Tracer goes from 2.45% to 7,76%  pickrate and 43.67% to 54.46% winrate, and almost the same ocurrs with genji, which goes from 3.00% to 6.54% and a winrate of 44.91% to 54.33%.With this stats, i can see Symmetra, Torbjorn and Junkrat Pickrates decay, but their winrates go up, where Tracer and Genji go to the Oposite. both pickrates and winrates go up. But why? The explanation goes into my mind is that the more up you go the ladder, the best you deal with the heroes with Decaying pickrate (Junk, Symmetra, Torbjorn), and the only ones remaining is the One Trick/ Mains of those heroes. Yet the GM/Master rank is filled with good Hitscan/Mobility heroes, with can be more effective overall.Yet i still fail to see in which point those heroes with a Higher Winrate and Low Pickrate are OP across all the ranks. if he is op, why his pickrate is decaying?The GM's and Masters fail to see how that hero is OP and choose to pick a weaker one?Thanks for proving that you don't understand what ""skewed winrate"" means. Torbjorn and Symmetra have skewed winrates because they are usually picked on 1st point of 2CP and Hybrid maps. Meaning, if the game results in a hold, they will both get credited with a full victory because during the entire defense round, they played that hero. However, if the hold is not succesful, people will usually swap from those heroes. And if the game is lost in the end, they will only get a 50% of the loss or 33% of the loss, depending on whether it's 2 CP or Hybrid.That's why they have unusually high winrates and very low pickrates. Same thing applies to their pickrate. For example, Torbjorn has a 0.65% pickrate in Platinum. That means that you would only see a Torb once in every 13 games. Which clearly isn't the case. Symmetra has 0.88% pickrate. Which means that you would see her once every ~10 games. Which also clearly isn't the case. That's why those are skewed. And as for the rest of your argument, it's normal that a characters winrate goes up as rank increases. Why? Because people in rank X don't play only versus rank X people. They also play versus people ranked higher than them and people ranked lower than them. To make an extreme example:Players in bronze play versus players in bronze but they also play versus players in silver. And generally, they will lose more to players in silver than they will win against them.Other end of it is grandmaster. GM plays against GM but they also play against Masters and sometimes even Diamond. And they will generally win versus diamonds more than diamonds will win against them. So you won't get much information looking at the pure winrate in some rank alone. But if you take a look at what happens with the winrate of the hero in a rank in relation to other heroes in the rank, that is a better indicator.Junkrat has the 2nd highest winrate and the highest pickrate out of all DPS characters in Bronze. Bastion has the highest winrate but Bastion also has 5 times smaller pickrate.Junkrat has the highest winrate and the highest pickrate out of all DPS characters in Silver. Junkrat has the highest winrate and the highest pickrate out of all DPS characters in Gold. Junkrat has the highest winrate and the 4th highest pickrate out of all DPS characters in Platinum. His pickrate is the 4th highest but they are all close (McCree 5.15%, Genji - 4.94%, 76 - 4.67%, Junkrat 4.52%)Junkrat has the highest winrate and the 6th highest pickrate out of all DPS characters in Diamond. Most picked is Genji with almost 6%. Junkrat has 3.86% pickrateJunkrat has the highest winrate and the 5th highest pickrate out of all DPS characters in Masters. Most picked is Genji with 6.32%. Junkrat has 3.54% pickrateJunkrat has the highest winrate and the 5th highest pickrate out of all DPS characters in Grandmaster. Most picked is Tracer with 7.76%. Junkrat has 3.29% pickrate.So, in essence, you see that even in GM, he still sees stable usage. 3.3% pickrate roughly translates to having a Junkrat on one of the teams that won't switch for the entire duration of the game in 2 out of 5 games. In every rank, he consistently stays at top of DPS characters with a very stable pickrate.For example, you take Pharah, which is a problem in some ranks for some people. She is the 2nd highest winrate DPS character in gold, platinum, diamond. Already in masters she loses a spot and drops to 3rd place and 76 takes her place. In GM she drops to 7th place in terms of winrate out of DPS characters. Why? Because hitscan skill drastically increases as you climb the ranks and she becomes very hard to play. Same thing with Tracer. Tracer has a negative winrate until diamond and masters where she is barely positive with 50.5% and on the bottom of the list of DPS characters. But then, in GM, she suddenly goes to 54.46%, putting her in the 4th place after Junkrat, Doomfist and 76. And that also makes sense. She's hard to get consistent value out of unless you're really good at tracking and have superior game sense (needed for every character but especially for her). In literally every other rank, you're better of playing 76 than Tracer. And that makes sense. But the fact that Junkrat is still up there even in GM suggests serious balance issues. More specifically, overpowered kit from which it is very easy to get value out of even in highest ranks."

If he's at range, you can see them with plenty of time to move, and if he's not in any danger then he's either behind a shield or he can't see what he's shooting at.You also pointed out the relevance of the comparison yourself by noting that they are both characters that prey on others mistakes.Besides, I chose Sym as an example because you were complaining about trap being annoying. My solution? If you know they have a Junkrat, check for traps. Either destroy them or pick another route. You know, the same way that if you know they have a Sym you don't just casually stroll through a choke point... you either destroy the turrets or you pick another route...If Junkrat is firing at you in a way that simply moving aside will dodge the projectile, he's not doing it right. If the projectiles land at your feet, you need to clear the blast zone, and with more bombs coming in at a very high pace (Unlike with Symmetra's RMB), your movement space is going to be very limited, which makes you vulnerable to getting picked off or dying because you tripped over a bomb that's been lying there for five seconds.Apart from the fact that some maps don't really give you a choice outside of going through the chokepoint (Eichenwalde, Hanamura, Volskaya), in Symmetra's case you do actually kind of just flat-out walk through the chokepoint. Carwashes are immensely inefficient defense strategies, they take forever to set up and are brought down in about .2 seconds with hard counters, and 2 seconds with anyone else. Symmetra preys on enemy mistakes in terms of her own positioning, and her ultimate. She punishes enemies who are thoroughly unaware of their surroundings and allow her to sneak up on them from behind, and she punishes enemies who do not hunt down her ultimate. Junkrat punishes people who play on the objective, because he doesn't -need- to see his targets, everything he has is excessive damage in AoE format. The general direction of the target is enough for him, much like it is enough for a Hanzo ult. ""Just pick a different chokepoint!"" also works against Symmetra much more than against Junkrat, because turning your camera takes less time than setting up a whole new car wash."

https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760626965,Is moira easier to be more effective with than mercy,NA,"The thing with Mercy, the biggest part you have to get down is game awareness and GA mechanics. Once you get that, everything else falls into place. Game awareness will keep you updated on who needs healing and where, and GA mechanics help in staying alive when in combination to game awareness. Moira needs to balance between attacking and healing to be effective. I have out-healed too many Moiras as Zenyatta without using his trans, and that shouldn't happen imo when she has almost 3x the amount of healing he does, without the use of her orb. However, she does still need to do damage because she needs it to charge her healing resource meter. So, that balance is necessary, and hard to maintain if you're not used to it."

Sounds nice, I am down. It will greatly help her durability over the course of the game. However in direct engagements it won't exactly be game changing (I.e. being dove by Gengu).Well, Zenyatta's regen and Mercy's regen don't save them when they're under attack, they just function as sustain. Lucio is already slippery as hell. Its job isn't to save her from flankers, just like it doesn't save Zenyatta and Mercy from flankers. She also has her sleep dart, decent damage, and her grenade if it's a tight spot.This suggestion is to help her sustain, which is sorely limited. Not just compared to other supports, but compared to other heroes. Other heroes have abilities or ways to heal themselves, many of them can afford to leave the team for a few seconds to grab a health kit, and all of them almost always have a support watching their backs. If you're a solo healer, you don't have any of that except your own sustain, and Ana doesn't even have that much.tl;dr it's not meant to be a life-saving game changer. It's meant to fix the problem of her having zero sustain."
https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760636807,What if Ana gained health by healing allies?,12/22/2017 8:59,"She does have something of a sustain issue, and using the grenade on yourself to heal is a huge sacrifice. Out of the healers, Zenyatta and Lucio aren't great solo healers but have regenerating shields and a heal aura respectively. Mercy is a main/solo healer with innate regen and Moira is a main/solo healer with oodles of sustain, but Ana is kind of left behind in this regard, which limits her ability to be a main or solo healer.So maybe instead of just health regen like Mercy, how about when healing allies, each shot grants her a small amount of health? Not enough to make her immune or anything, but enough to grant her sustain to hang around without being a 10hp target for flankers or needing to abandon the team to find a health pack. I don't know numbers, but maybe 10-15 a shot, or a percentage of the healing done, similar to Reaper's passive.I'm obviously no pro, but it might help make her feel better to play, and make her a bit more viable. Can we at least try it out?"

I'd love it if they reverted to that. Scrap to upgrade to level 3 plus a turn rate nerf so it can be avoided because of how much damage it can do.I like it - but I'd prefer a very fast turn and a fraction of second delay - again like the engie - this way it would be fast enough to kill a Genji trying to run across a good sized gap - and makes it so you still take  a little damage if peeking depending on which way it's facing (engie sentries scan back and forth while idle iirc)"

https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760636877,Small Torb Buffs,12/23/2017 1:23,"Before people freak out on me because torb is wrecks in their elo realize that Torbs performance decreases hugely the higher rank you go. Plus these buffs are targeted more towards higher on the ladder anyway. So Im sure minor nerfs could come with a change, but this thread is for buffs. 1. ReloadTorbs reload is painfully slow it is the third slowest reload in the game (I think) yet can be gone through pretty quickly. I would suggest lowering the reload from 2 secs to 1.5. It isnt a super big buff, but it would get rid of that frustration. Secondly, his ult should have even quicker reload or unlimited ammo. Nothing is worse than you just shredding through your clip with increased firing speed, but having to take a 2 sec break in the middle.2. Head HitboxHis head hitbox is way to large. Its literally like a watermelon. He just absolutely gets destroyed by mcrees, hanzos, and soldiers. Not to mention his head hitbox takes up a lot of his torso leading to body shots being crits. We need to lower the hitbox so it actually covers his head and then well be good.3. Unhack Yes, Sombra is underpowered and needs a buff. At the same time though when a Sombra emps to push in I want to immediately core when Im unhacked so I could potentially stop the push. But you cant, for whatever reason it takes longer to unhack than you. Just why? It doesnt make sense.4. Pack to upgrade This one is definitely the most buffiest of all them, but it is aimed at attack torb. People ask me what would make attack torb viable by the average Joe. I tell them nothing will, but this would help. Right now amour pack serves one purpose, to give armour (its kinda in the title lol), but I think it could serve another purpose. Throwing an armour pack on a lvl 1 turret instantly upgrades it to a lvl 2. This can lead to pushes with immediate lvl 2s or even lvl3s with core. It also would only help on defense when your turret is destroyed and it is a team fight which isnt too powerful, but still good.So thoughts, anything to add, or think torb is fine. This post will probably get downvoted, but we have to face it, he needs a buff."

He already can't kill any tanks with the combo, and if he's too slow I think Ana or Zarya can save a teammate, and he can't kill Mei, Bastion, Reaper, Doomfist, Moia (if she times her fade right) etc. Or anyone with armour of shield-gen... Adding Lucio and anyone Lucio is near to the list is a bit much...and i think that is just fine. Moira, Bastion, Mei, Zarya, Ana, Reaper, Lucio: SHOULD junkrat remain strong against these heroes? what about their perspective?I literally just said he wasn't strong against them because his trap/mine combo doesn't work on them, but I'll put that down to a misunderstanding... I think it would be like if Mei's freeze+icicle worked on even less heroes... it's an important part of her kit. Junkrat is actually strong against Doomfist, but that's largely due to his big hitbox and his need to deal damage up close. Zarya can make him a huge liability. It's not like the guy doesn't have his counters, I think one of the reasons people are so mad is because he's more common in games these days and he can be frustrating, and they experience that much more... but I don't think that's only due to his buffs, a lot of things that irritate people existed before those...I think it's okay to look at making some minor changes to him, but it's important for people to consider a way that doesn't remove him from viability entirely. I'd be happy to see Roadhog completely gone, but Roadhog mains don't want that so all I can do is shrug my shoulders and accept that I'll always run into him from time to time.

You nerf the mines, you nerf the Trap+Mine combo, and that's half of his kit.I think he should have a damage radius on the mines, though. Point blank would still result in death/heavy damage (and this preserves the viability of the Trap+Mine combo), but he wouldn't be able to kill you by randomly tossing it in your general direction. The farther out from the center of the mine, the less damage.i like this too, but i can agree with both sides.either reduce the damage or just apply more skill to the double-mine combo."

SKILLRATRemember that hitscan aim is not the be-all-end-all of skill in OverwatchThat's horrendous game design. Game should always reward mechanically demanding heroes compared to heroes with low skill floor. But that isn't currently happening. A good Junkrat uses the mines to move effectively, but it takes more skill to move efficiently with the mine than it takes to teleport around or spam a double jump with the ability to climb walls - in fact Junkrat's mobility option takes away from his close-ranged firepower to use - something other heros don't have to worry about with their mobility optionsIT DOESN'T TAKE ANYTHING. HE STILL HAS 1 MINE TO USEGenji's dash to get somewhere atakes away his damage. Tracer's blink to get somewhere fast hamper her ability to deal damage at all since she needs blinks to get close to deal damage. Doomfist's rocket punch when used for mobility takes away his main damage dealing ability. Sombra's translocator when used to get somewhere leaves her without her main escape option on which she 100% depends. This is the only character that can use something to get somewhere and still have a backup charge of it to deal damage. Junkrat must choose where to lay his traps and where to throw bombs when he is using indirect support - he needs to manage the push and pull to decide when to advance and engage directly or even flank or instead apply indirect pressure/area denial - the better Junkrats seem to have a ""psychic"" sense of where someone is going to go and will already have a mine ready'Traps are not the problem. His spam is not the problem. Burst damage without any falloff in the entire blast radius done by his mines is. And he has 2 of those. Hitting with grenades from a distance directly isn't easy - it is a slow projectile and it's arc, like Mei's delay is just one more thing to have to take into account when aimingThat's why they gave him a high rate of fire and high damage to compensate for that. When his opponents are not stupidly feeding, the rat player needs to be canny and smart in order to maintain impact comparable to simply taking Tracer or GenjiHE SHOULD NOT HAVE IMPACT COMPARABLE TO HEROES WHO ACTUALLY TAKE SKILLA GAME THAT REWARDS SKILLESS HEROES OVER HEROES THAT ACTUALLY TAKE SKILL IS A POORLY DESIGNED GAMESeriously, just kill him from outside of mine range - like if Genji actually kill him entirely with ranged shuirkens rather than relying on triple shuriken to the face and or swift-strike like a crutch - you know, use that ""skill"" that Genji mains are always yammering aboutYes because there are not covers on every map everywhere. And barriers are not a thing. At all. Yes, this means the best move may be to not approach a control point or a payload until Junkrat has been killed or you have a team push with a numbers advantage - it's comparable to how D.Va suppresses certain ults until she has been de-mechedJunkrat will literally never go down first unless he gets cocky and misplays.Stop spreading bad propaganda."

Sure, I shouldn't be able to blow her out of the sky, but I should at least be able to land 3 bullets out of 60.Don't get me started on how inconsistent EMP is with stopping Ultimates mid cast. You have to hit EMP THE MILLISECOND Genji/Soldier/Bastion/Rein or whoever starts the Ultimate. If you have even a slight delay or are off by litteral milliseconds, EMP does nothing to counter a cast.The allowance window needs to be slightly bigger.Sombra needs help. A lot of it."

Tracer can blink in your face three times and blast you with one clip, Junkrat can launch himself up in the air shoot you once then throw mine at you and boom youre dead, Genji can quickly shoot a few Shurikens at your head, swift strike through you, turn around and use your own abilities against you with his Deflect, but yet Sombra cant come out of Stealth without saying an entire sentence having the entire team notice her before she can even shoot one bullet?? Umm.. HELLOOO!! Shes a STEALTH HERO.. thats what they do, catch you by suprise!! That doesnt make her OP, that just fits her playstyle, if you know theirs an enemy Sombra, be aware of her flanking you!! Its not rocket science to make a 180° turn and fight back, especially when your team is there with you. I mean cmon, Blizzard acts like Sombra coming out of Stealth turns her weapon into a giant nuclear laser that melts your insides.. Sombra deserves to at least be on level with Genji and Tracer people have been saying that for over a year now if anything, it's only helping her get out of the blackhole she's stuck in.Also D.VA is not a problem at all its very easy to get her out of her Mech, you werent paying attention to the problem, the point is that D.VAs little pellets across the map take you out of Stealth with 1 damage which is ridiculous, Sombras abilities get canceled more than the enemies shes trying to hack, thats just not right. Sombra can be very effective being a disruptor dealing a bit of damage than teleporting away to farm her EMP, but her ultimate should not be her #1 priority when it comes to good viability. Sombra is only viable because of her EMP, hence why everyone literally uses her as a Support, even the OWL uses her to fill a Support Slot because all she can do is farm her EMP and give heals, while not dealing enough damage.  Sombra needs power shifted away from her constant EMP farming, and more power onto her actual kit so she can be more viable on her own without having to hold her teammates hands after she spent the entire game teleporting back and forth intentionally taking damage to gain ultimate charge?? Not to mention her Machine Pistol spread.. how is she supposed to be the hero that finishes people off if she cant even get to the low HP enemy thats most likely behind their teammates, and theirs a 99% chance that youll get shot out of Stealth forcing you to teleport away, not even getting the finish on them. Even if you dont have to get near them, its not like you can shoot them at a distance either, her Weapon spread is ridiculous so the bullets are hardly ever going to hit them to finish them off, Sombras gun acts like a target thats 10 feet away is actually far away on another planet.A stealth hero like Sombra has so much potential yet she acts like a broken record going back and forth. There was even a bug when she was first released that allowed players to get rid of the Stealth delay and it worked fine and felt way smoother than what it is now and it wasnt OP at all. And ofcourse, Sombra is already pretty good, but any hero can be good for the little amount of players that invest so much time into playing them, but that doesnt make the hero good or the other 99% of the playerbase.Sure, Blizzard mightve said they dont want Sombra to be an assassin, but that was a year ago, look how their plan turned out, all Sombra is, is an EMP bot that is counted as a Support Hero. It makes no sense. Its been over a year and Sombra has been more worthless than Doomfist considering her release date.Blizzard has to change Sombra, they didnt like how Mercy and D.VA were Resurrect bots and Defense Matrix bots, so they reworked them and even gave them new abilities, Sombra needs the same treatment."

He just can't do anything against a Junkrat it's like getting hacked but you get murdered by Junk instead. I'm not necessarily in favor of nerfing Junkrat though, his counters need to be buffed, we just need more ways of dealing with him, that's all. Although I would not be biased to him hurting himself again with his own explosives. Do the mines need to be nerfed? Honestly I don't think so, they really have given him the much needed mobility and versatility he's needed. Making him hurt himself again would be a simple revert that would punish incredibly reckless Junkrats from just, well, being reckless.

Now listen, I understand Pharah hard counters him and she's a strong hero in general but it's just a little ridiculous that she's one of the only solid counters to him. Widows and Hanzos are encouraged to step it up and try to take him down but it's just really jarring how most of the cast can't do much against a good Junkrat. I especially feel bad for Doomfist. He just can't do anything against a Junkrat it's like getting hacked but you get murdered by Junk instead. I'm not necessarily in favor of nerfing Junkrat though, his counters need to be buffed, we just need more ways of dealing with him, that's all. Although I would not be biased to him hurting himself again with his own explosives. Do the mines need to be nerfed? Honestly I don't think so, they really have given him the much needed mobility and versatility he's needed. Making him hurt himself again would be a simple revert that would punish incredibly reckless Junkrats from just, well, being reckless. A good Junk keeps some order to his chaos and that's what makes them good. Whether you like it or not he can put out an absurd amount of damage without thinking at all and something should be done about that.Doomfist can't do anything against anything. He shouldn't even be in this game in the state he's in. That goes for at least 1/3rd of the roster, though."

Even a good gengi can be countered by a decent winston. Tracer on the other hand... mcree is a high skill hero that few people can actually reliably counter tracer with, people rarely pick torb and get flammed when they do and sym isnt a great choice either (especially with moiras orb atm) , and those are some of tacers best counters. even the pros just pick another tracer to counter tracer and no hero should require you to pick the same hero to counter it. So onto Mei. Her spray already reduces movement speed but by the time it freezes an enemy they can get in, kill their target and get out before being frozen. Even though people complain about mei's freeze,  theirs a reason shes not popular in death match and rarely used at diamond and above. So now the actual mei buff:-1 SLIGHTLY increase her freeze speed or SLIGHTLY increase its range maybe 1 or 2 meters-2 Her ice spray reduces the distance travelled of movement skills, so once you start being sprayed, your blink/ dash/ leap/ jump jet/ doomfist/ boosters etc has its effectiveness (travel distance) reduced over time. It takes about 1.5 seconds to freeze an enemy so for every 0.5 secs you lose 1/3 of the travel distance of a movement skill while her chill effect is in place.-3 Icicle has a slow effect that lasts for 0.5 seconds. Example:  D.va is being sprayed by mei and uses boosters to escape (12m travel distance). 0.5s of being sprayed = 8m travelled by boosters, 1second of being sprayed = on 4 meters travelled by boosters and 1.5s sprayed = frozen.So in short, She should be the character that speed based heroes are afraid to get close to. This will also ensure dive doesnt become to dominant again without having to nerf any of those heroes."

The Shimada dragons and Zenyatta's robo-Buddha orbs imply that magic does exist in the Overwatch universe, so it's not so far-fetched that Ana has some sort of magic darts and fluid that are actually just hexed or something. I mean otherwise she'd just be a stupid character that got wedged in as a cool idea with little regard for the non-biotic and armored cast.Of course this would open up more possibilities. Widowmaker's nerve-gas mine, Moira's Golden Shower healing (you can't convince me that that's science no matter how hard you try), and even Reaper's health-leech (RIP Soul Orbs) could all just be magic.

Blizzard is coddling and rewarding these scumbags who are harassing and banning people for playing Torb and Sym. Did you really think it would stop with those characters?

https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760676960,Some Mei Tips - For Fun!,12/22/2017 20:39,"Now some of these may be a skosh outdated (or lack extensive testing) but, I saw a thread asking people to share 1 tip about their main (or Mein; in my case) and I couldn't decide on 1 tip! So I compiled a list of little tips that I have found to be valuable and that I have learned in my time playing Mei so far and I wanted to share my knowledge! Now I know Mei could use some QOL changes and a few tweaks here or there but, regardless of that, I really enjoy her and always have! So here goes nothing. I hope you guys enjoy and make use of these!Mei Tips:-You can freeze somebody in a couple seconds with primary fire. The stream from Mei's gun is actually more of consecutive ""puffs,"" if you will, (Like tiny clouds) than an actual stream of fire. The best policy for a quick freeze is to aim, as closely as possible to an enemy and where the enemy WILL BE as oppose to where they currently are. Because Mei's weapon is not hitscan, this results in a more reliable freeze. This helps, particularly, with denying mobile heroes.-On that same note, it is best to attempt a freeze on heroes after they have used their escapes. I.E. A Genji who has just dashed into your back line, a tracer who is absent-mindedly blinking and recalling, a Sombra who has just trans-located, a Moira who has just phased, etc.-Mei's freeze is a great tool for not only securing kills but interrupting enemies. Flank and bum-rush heroes mid-ult to be extra annoying.Most of the time a McRee or a Road Hog are ulting, they are focusing on getting kills; not you. This can result in a reliable stop to many ults and sometimes a kill. Heck, it can even be useful to interrupt healing!-Zarya can bubble frozen heroes to cleanse a freeze. You can also activate her personal bubble as she is about to freeze to cleanse the slow and deny an impending freeze.-If you listen closely to the sound being broadcast as somebody comes close to freezing, you can actually time RMB just right and hit enemies right as they freeze. This can result in you being able to land up to a triple headshot on heroes. Combined with a punch, at the end, this can kill even some Tanks.-You can use Mei's Ice Block as cover - similar to her wall. (You can also Iceblock on top of frozen enemies and create extra cover for allies) I have jumped in front of a D.Va bomb and saved allies many times (Or so it appears).-Mei's iceblock can also be canceled early. This can help take enemies off-guard or helps you to avoid being trapped and mined by a Junkrat (Junk Mine can 1-shot Mei due to her hitbox)-Mei Iceblock now cleanses Ana grenade (This was a 2+ year-long bug)-Mei wall can be put under your feet or allied hero's feet to break Junkrat traps instantly (It can also be used on enemies postmortem for hilarious body launches).-Similarly, you can actually place a Mei wall under your own feet and jump right as it peaks to avoid being hurt by a Doomfist ult; when timed properly it completely avoids it.-Another fun thing is to place a wall between you and the enemy team as soon as a Zarya ult lands (Remember, you can drop your wall whenever you feel like it). You can also wall-off Mcree ults this way. This can really take people off-guard or even lure enemies into a false sense of security only to have your wall dropped and them ulted.-Use her wall to sneak around choke points guarded by Torb turrets or Bastions. Each pillar can eat 500 or so damage before breaking.-Mei wall eats Moira orbs and can completely ruin her planned trajectory for them.-You can also use Mei's wall to trap enemies in allied hero ults such as Road Hog or Pharah or Secure a Doomfist punch kill.-When dueling a Doomfist, as Mei, you can win every time. Just wait for him to let out a rocket punch and block it with an ability, do the same as he tries to spam abilities and, with proper tracking, you'll freeze and icicle his face in no time (Just try to avoid dueling close to walls).-Similarly, you can block Rein charges.-Mei wall shines when it is used to split enemy teams and secure kills. It can, however, also be used defensively to negate nasty ults like a D.Va bomb. You can use it to wall yourself into corners, indoors, to save yourself from Winstons, Genjis, and other ults too. I recommend blocking Moira ult, Road Hog Ult, and D.Va Ult with it. You can even block some junkrat ults with good timing.-Use Mei wall to sneak up into high positions and freeze enemy snipers. Note that they will be the bane of your existence in-game but, even some experienced snipers suffer from tunnel vision and will fall victim to a freeze and the following abrupt icicle lobotomy; without proper attention.-Fun Fact: You can use Mei Wall, when placed under your feet and far enough onto the corner, on the second point of Hanamura to sneak in the back way. Just jump as you reach the edge of your wall and you will make it!-Mei's RMB can 1-shot a Tracer if you can plant one in her noggin. It is also one of the fastest ways to charge your ult. Be sure to try and land headshots on Tanks like D.VA &amp; Road Hog. They can basically be your personal ult battery.-Fun Fact: Mei's ult requires a little longer to charge than your average ult.-Use Mei icicles in your downtime to poke and charge your ult and to harass Pharahs. Even though it has fall-off damage, the poke you provide can help secure kills and ward off pesky attackers/flankers - even if you aren't getting head shots. Remember, Mei's icicle also has a slight arc at longer ranges. An experienced Mei can out-duel other long-range heroes at mid-range. Just time the RMB fire delay right!-Be sure to flank unsuspecting Reinhardts (Especially if you can catch them alone). You can shoot a freeze ray up their butts and stun them - effectively locking them out of their barrier and potentially exposing the enemy team or securing a kill. It should also be noted that you can literally run circles around some Reins and use your primary fire to freeze them even if they are trying to block you.-During Mei ult, you can freeze somebody with primary fire in less than a second (with good aim). Use this on heroes you know can escape (Which is most of them). You can also lightly touch heroes with your primary and they will freeze in the order you specify. As far as I know, as long as they are in your ult, they will stay frozen. For this reason, Mei Ult never actually NEEDS to be paired with any other ult. Just mop up some free Popsicle kills.-FUN FACT: Roughly 25 of the heroes have a very high chance of escaping your ult if they are paying attention.-In regards to her ult, the best policy is to throw it when you are unseen. You can throw it straight up to delay its activation or you can simply throw it behind the enemy team, when pushing, and they will back into it. Alternatively, use your wall to close the enemy team's escape. No need to be shy, get in there and start shooting some icicles!-Mei's ult can be canceled by D.Va Matrix or even deflected by a skilled Genji; before it lands. Keep this in mind as a deflected Mei ult can wind up securing your enemy a team kill.-Mei ult also freezes enemies slightly above or below it.-Mei shines on payload maps. Her little body can actually effectively hide behind almost every single payload; when she crouches. This protects you from 90+% of enemy fire and snipers and forces them to run up to the payload to get you off of it. This puts them right in freezing range. Wall them off, freeze them, and secure a kill on your over-extended and unprotected new friend.-Mei is a-mei-zing at staling points and payloads. Many Meins don't like the fact that this is part of her character but, it serves teams well often enough. Use your wall and iceblock to be pesky and stall points until your team arrives. This is exceptionally helpful during overtime.-Mei can function as an off-tank when played well.-As Mei, Snipers, discord orbs, and Pharah's will prove tough to handle. Use LOS well and practice countering people. Discord orb falls off after 3 seconds out of Zen's LOS (So does Harmony). #Itgetsbetter.-Lastly, Mcree will be your arch nemesis. Bait out his flash bang, in close range, and Iceblock or wall to negate it. After that, dance around and freeze him. If he doesn't headshot you at least twice, you will probably win the duel. Don't forget: There is a slight delay between iceblock and wall activation that lets bullets and effects through. This can result in a canceled Iceblock and death or getting headshot through your wall. Time it appropriately.Have fun my little Ice Queens!"

Hack is and always has been underwhelming in terms of power, especially compared to how easy it is to interrupt.

I get he would be incredibly annoying if this happened though, but once he puts himself into a fight, he's open to being CC'd in any way, and knockups mean nothing to characters with any mobility or CC abilities.  Also way too many characters have some sort of strange auto-resistance to knockback effects so they stop before they hit the wall, or worse, ones like Tracer/Genji recall/dash out of it despite their stunned status the moment they hit the wall.Also, doorframes due to their strange rounded angles still cause enemies to bounce off of them without taking damage.They said they still had some work to do on him though so hopefully when they finish the next round of bug fixes for him in Jan he'll be a bit better."

Instead use him to kill genjis and tracers or reapers (careful if you miss, hell destroy you in a couple shots otherwise), blow Winston out of his bubble- use him to disrupt reins on the front line, blowing him way back and out of position. If youre quick you can uppercut him, tap him with an RP to really get some distance on him (great on maps with fall offs, straight up delete him with nothing he can do about it!), and then use slam to escape back behind your team.

Great well thought out idea here though.Especially when dealing with genji/tracer mains who are nearly impossible to hit at the moment unless they get trapped by a Junkrat, which is unlikely.Trying to track Genji specifically is Really bad on console right now...Even though you are point blank, you can't do enough damage When you hit him.. and IF you do, he always has reflect up by that point anyway.

https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760686909,Reasons why the hereos fight against each other,12/22/2017 23:03,"So I was always wondering why the heck the Overwatch hereos fight with and against each other. I mean like, Overwatch is such a story-based game, why shouldn't there be a reason why the hereos fight? A Tracer killing Winston? Or even worse, Winston killing Winston? As you may already noticed, it doesn't make sense at all and still I haven't found an official explanation why that happens.So, let me tell you my theories about that topic :D (Please excuse any mistakes I make, English is not my mother tongue nor I live in an english speaking country)1. Overwatch itself is a training program for the hereos of Overwatch &gt; The hereos of Overwatch can train their skills without killing actual people (or things) in a simulation (maybe made by Athena?) to train their skills. Good Overwatch hereos can fight against good Overwatch hereos to train their skills and be prepared for a worst-case scenario (maybe a blackwatch hereo who can hack into the minds of people... who knows...)2. Overwatch, the game we play right now, is a game made for people to trust more into Overwatch&gt; Overwatch could be somekind of merchandise or... well, a game made by that Overwatch museum we saw in the original trailer to build up more trust for Overwatch. It's a well known game in the world and people can play with their favorite hereos, along with lots of ow merchandise and fan posters hanging in their rooms. :DI can't think of more reasons, what's your opinion on that topic? Tell me in the comments :3"

Anyone can take her out in any situation.She ruins FFA for everyone. She's either camping different areas every 30 seconds or is running around for the lone McCree or Widowmaker. She steals kills and her turrets in tight spots are unfair. You either make your game boring trying to counter her or have to suffer everytime she shields and runs up to you with her beam.Playing as her is the easiest job ever. Hold left click and start jumping, and you basically won on defense on QP.Her three stages of damage is a bit much too. On full power, with armor she can kill a Winston without any trouble.Basically, she's unbalanced in every way and ruins the experience for everyone.I know some will completely agree or disagree.

Long story short, it's catering to casuals.Even though the removal of performance-based SR is a step away from the casual playstyle, Blizzard took 3 steps back in by saying it's not punishable if you don't work with your team, essentially advocating that you can be a selfish player so long as you're ""trying your best"". Even the devs know what they're adovocating shouldn't be done in Competitive, yet they're not gonna take action. And with performace-based SR still being present in lower ranks, it will soon be filled with selfish and care-less players, becomeing the next QP where you can earn golden guns. Tell me, who does these statements cater to?"

I didn't even finish my placement matches the first two seasons I tried out comp. Then I found a bunch of friends to play with and while there's still some nervousness when I play, I know we'll at least all try to support and encourage each other even if we lose. Now I was lucky in that a few people I know in real life play and one of them is exceptionally outgoing and made a bunch of friends who now make up our core play group. That's the best way to get into comp. Find people who you enjoy playing with and gel with.  And ignore the people who complain about 'casuals.' We're all gamers and people who say otherwise just want to make themselves feel special."

It's a TEAM game, and yet so many people forgo that aspect and try to do it alone.  That is why there are so many kids lashing out.... because it's easy to feel like you're back is against the wall when the entire other team is trash talking you, along with a few people on your own team.  It's enough to make you think ""wow this game sucks"" when it's actually a quality title.Anyway, when you've a 6-stack, those people can have your back.

Why not just remove the melee attack. In fact why not just remove Ana completely, you tortured her enough with nerfs and releasing much better and dummer characters that doesn't even have to aim.New nerf ideas; 1. Ana's ulti now doesn't buff anyone. We decided that it is better than buffing just one person for 0 seconds.2. Ana's rifle will hit your allies everytime you try to shoot an enemy, even if there are no allies at your screen. Now Ana heals %99999 billion million more because thats exactly what she needs, just look at her visage, she doesn't look like a deadly sniper at all she doesn't have to do damage even if she have to aim but non-aim characters should do %99999999999999999999999999999999999999 more damage.3.

Or nerf Valkyrie. She has the most consistent healing in the game, and really good mobility.  She fits a roll no other healer can fulfill.- Ana gets bufu'd by flankers cause of her lack of mobility, and by barriers for healing. Requires a really high skill to land and duel any sort of flank coming at you. Zenny follows this philosophy too.- Lucio is okay. Ultimate change hurt him a lot. Wall ride change hurt him a lot. I stopped playing Lucio outside of closed beta so I don't really want to comment on what I feel he needs. - Zenyatta is interesting. He is rather easy to kill, but you still got to respect him. He can heal through barriers, but his healing is super low. Maybe since he single target heals, and the orb requires line of sight to stay on longer it should get a buff? Not sure.- Moira is absolutely fun. Great mobility, interesting gameplay. She suffers from the lack of consistent healing, and the nerf to her orb hitting barriers really stopped her from opening up chokes. I don't think she needs any changes outside of the healing orb not being able to get eaten by DVA/Reflected by genji. While she does get high healing numbers, it is sort of like what Lucio used to do before he got nerfed in that her healing is usually spread out and in really large bursts. She isn't as consistent as Mercy, and has no aerial access like Mercy as well.Mercy is the hardest to kill of the healers cause of her mobility is only limited by your team. A Moira playing selfishly is pretty good at surviving too, but she has limited healing resource where as Mercy does not. So until there is another high mobility, single target healer that doesn't get punished by barriers, and doesn't run out of resource Mercy will always be a good pick."

Still no arguments address the fact she has a near perfect pickrate and is always the choice.I am just arguing that we should not only judge a hero's power-level based on pick-rate alone, but also take the role into account. Otherwise there is going to be constant nerfs to Mercy until we come to a tipping point where it makes no sense playing Mercy at all. Mercy fulfils a unique role as the only dedicated healer that focuses solely on keeping team-members alive, and as such she'll have the highest pick-rate even if she ends up being completely balanced... If they keep nerfing her at that point just because she still has high pick-rate she'll end up being underpowered.Well ya that's the point she needs to hit a tipping point then possibly get a small buff after. Why should she not be on that line(tipping point) while ever other hero is much closser to it.Arguing you shouldn't balance her at all bc eventually she will be underwhelming is just dumb.It's like saying ya big businesses we're out of control in the industrial revolution but let's not put any labor laws in place or businesses might all leave."

And a slight ult charge nerf. By reducing the damage on mines, it will also reduce the speed of charging of his ultimate. Because currently, mines are what enable him to do so. He simply throws a mine into a group of enemies and boom, 120 damage flat to everyone in the radius. Then he throws an another one. He shouldn't be able to deal that much guaranteed damage. Currently, it is the by far the best source of burst damage in the game. And he has 2 of them. Damage that would otherwise likely be healed away. It means that as soon as 200 HP hero loses 40% of his healthpool to anything, he is likely dead. To a skillless ability. And he can even combo you with mines only, but it's rarer. By reducing the mine damage to 80, he still keeps his grenade + mine combo. He loses the trap + mine combo but it is rarely used anyways. The only time it's used is on the start of the round.

This allows you to do all kinds of cool stuff like launch yourself into a fight and still have a charge to escape with, or launch yourself up into a Pharah and still have a charge to try and kill her with. Previously this was possible before but you had to plant one on the ground and then wait for the cooldown to come back before doing this. That is still possible, which allows for a triple jump now if you want/need that, but now it is a lot more reliable to do with 2.

Fact is, if you prevent mine as an escape mechanic, he's a very, very easy target, and most people can just jump him since they have no need to fear him using mine offensively... he'd be trash.They could make it so it explodes immediately when its under you, so you could technically just point down and Shift to launch yourself.

Flying up to an overconfident Junkrat and blasting guns and rockets at him, then eating his mine, and quickly finishing him off... it's not too difficult, especially if you have a healer or someone helping you.Genji can deflect Junkrat's mine, D.Va can eat it, Zarya can bubble, other heroes can dodge it or use one of their abilities to get out the way... When getting dived by a Winston, his jump usually destroys any mine you have ready. I'm just telling you the facts mate. Maybe Junkrat isn't the problem but you should consider switching heroes or altering your playstyle when you encounter him? Or is that too much in a video game that is about counters and altering playstle and teamwork to outwit the enemy?"

It takes minimal positionement and map awareness to be able to apply pressure with JR from range while out of line of sight thanks to the richochet nades.His only reliable hardcounters are Pharah and maybe Moira, but using cancer to kill cancer is not a cure guys.Moira does not counter him in any way, if anything he counters her due to his burst damage. Counters to Junkrat include: Pharah, Zarya, D.Va, a good Widow, a good Genji... he has counters, but the most reliable way of dealing with him is altering playstyle. Don't linger in chokes, don't go into enclosed spaces... If you see him as a huge threat, pick D.Va, Winston and Genji or Pharah, then all dive him at once and delete him before moving in...Hell D.Va alone can wreck Junkrat lol"

https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760696925,Hanzo > Widow,NA,"Widow and Hanzo, while appearing very similar, are actually radically different skill sets. Hanzo is best at mid range, peeking corners, and spamming arrows. Body shots do 125 full charge, and his wall climb and sonic arrows provide useful situational benefits. Being a projectile, the arrows are actually somewhat easy to predict and avoid in comparison to widowmakers hitscan. 250 damage headshots vs 300 damage. Widowmaker is best at medium- long range. A hanzo close trumps you due to scattershot and quicker arrow charge. Widowmaker's hook is far better than wall climb, but its on a cooldown so it averages out imo. Try running from a winston or dva as hanzo... Try getting around reinhardt shield as hanzo... get to the top of the map as hanzo...  Killing pharah is FAR easier with widowmaker, as well as mercy and other high mobility characters minus scatter shot. Widowmaker and hanzo both have their situations that one is better than the other, but skill makes up the difference. A god tier widow will be useful where a ""decent"" hanzo is not, and vice versa.

https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760696925,Hanzo > Widow,NA,"Widow and Hanzo, while appearing very similar, are actually radically different skill sets. Hanzo is best at mid range, peeking corners, and spamming arrows. Body shots do 125 full charge, and his wall climb and sonic arrows provide useful situational benefits. Being a projectile, the arrows are actually somewhat easy to predict and avoid in comparison to widowmakers hitscan. 250 damage headshots vs 300 damage. Widowmaker is best at medium- long range. A hanzo close trumps you due to scattershot and quicker arrow charge. Widowmaker's hook is far better than wall climb, but its on a cooldown so it averages out imo. Try running from a winston or dva as hanzo... Try getting around reinhardt shield as hanzo... get to the top of the map as hanzo...  Killing pharah is FAR easier with widowmaker, as well as mercy and other high mobility characters minus scatter shot.

https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760706959,Doomfist idea.,NA,"That sounds worse than barrier though. At least with barriers he can exceed his maximum health, lifesteal only works after he's taken damage, and if he's gotten the jump on someone that means he created a window they can attack him and he can't heal or escape.If you expect the healing to be significant enough to make up for this, why not just buff the existing barriers instead of giving him the same passive as reaper?"

I don't buy it, they could easily create free content with the money they have made from sales alone. Apparently they have 35 million active accounts. 35 million x $40 = 1.4 billion. Lootboxes are a feature to keep the cash cow milking people of money by giving them a chance to get an item then coercing people who don't get the item to roll the dice again. It's insidious but people believe the narrative that without them the game would fail and content would not be free when evidently they've made more than enough for that not to be the case.You don't have to buy lootboxes? It's a cosmetic thing. Like... I don't have to buy an Overwatch shirt if I don't want... sure it would be nice, but I can decide if I want to put my money into it or if the cosmetic value of that shirt just isn't worth it. You can still get lootboxes for free by playing, and buy skins using currency if you don't get the ones you want but you've been grinding. It's not like they give you an ingame advantage. Some people have lots of money and they can afford to throw a little away, and those are the kind of people it targets. If you can't afford it, don't buy them?It's a valid point they are not essential for gameplay however if this is the case and have no impact why not let people directly purchase the skins they want then? Why hide them behind this RNG system. Time is more valuable than money. Why spend an hour or two of my life to grind for a skin when I could buy it. But not outright you have to purchase the chance. That is the fundamental problem I have with the lootbox system. People with addiction problems may not have the willpower to resist the temptation. Restrictions need to be in place I just don't see the necessity for the RNG system. Well I know why it's there I disagree with the practice and nature of it."

In fact they promote events primarily on the new skins that are releasing in that event. People buy loot boxes for the chance of getting a new event skin. I'm not against promoting skins but ask yourself why not just allow people to buy individual skins?You see a player with an unreal looking skin for your favourite hero and tell me they don't matter.Take a car for instance would you rather the latest ferrari or the old ford focus. Both will get you from A to B but it's the social and aesthetic value that it exudes which is the difference and cosmetic items in overwatch are no different."

Blizzard a multi billion dollar company decided they'll not pay employees till after the release. You evidently do not have a grasp of how a business functions. Considering I have a business degree I do understand. Blizzard would set a budget say $200 million for development, marketing and staff salaries. Say the game production cost $100 million, marketing $80 million and staff salaries $20 million. That is what they call an investment and evidently the investment has paid off. The game at this point has made $1.4 billion from box sales what are you even talking about."

https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760716149,"I want to one-trick Hanzo, but...",NA,"Hey, everyone. I just wanted to chime in, because theres definitely some confusion around one-tricking, and we wanted to take a moment to clarify our philosophy as a development team.We believe players can choose to play any available hero during any game at any time, and that their choice of hero alone is not a behavior that should be penalized by our customer service team under any of the player report categories (including griefing, inactivity, or poor teamwork).We believe players should be evaluated based on their actions with whichever hero they choose. If a player disrupts their team by intentionally feeding with ANY hero, you should report that player for griefing. If a player is staying in the spawn area, refuses to attack the enemy, or refuses support those that are, you should report that player for inactivity. If a player actively refuses to play the maps objectives or communicates to the team in a negative fashion, you should report that player for poor teamwork. If a player communicates in a hateful or harassing manner with ANY hero, you should report that player for abusive chat. However, if a teammate is actively trying to perform well on their hero and help their team, they should NOT be reported under any category.Players who inaccurately submit player reports in an attempt to punish someones hero choice are considered to be harassing or griefing their fellow player, and inaccurate reports make it more difficult for us to appropriately action the players who DO disrupt the game. Were continuing to make improvements to our reporting system (which includes, but certainly isnt limited to making our false report detection more robust), and we will continue to pay close attention to players who are at high risk of being falsely reported and taking appropriate actions to prevent it.Your teammates can respectfully provide their opinion and suggest using a different hero for the gameplay situation that your team is experiencing, but the final decision about which hero you want to play with is yours alone.We built Overwatch around the concept of teamwork, and we believe the game is much more fun for everyone in a match when were picking heroes that contribute to the overall success of the team. At times, this means well be playing our mains; other times, we should be trying to help the team by choosing heroes that round out the teams composition. We wont be actioning you if you only play your main, but we also dont believe this is the ideal way to play Overwatchespecially in competitive settings."

The key to whether you're likely to be reported, unfairly or otherwise, will be your consistent ability to perform across varying compositions. If you're team is uncoordinated but have more ""in meta"" picks, expect blame to be tossed your way whenever the actual source of fault is ambiguous. Expect to need to be perceived as better than average in your game sense and personality to be able to persistently play an off-meta character across all compositions without facing significant complaint -- any of which which in turn makes the game harder for you to salvage or repair."

I just wanted to chime in, because theres definitely some confusion around one-tricking, and we wanted to take a moment to clarify our philosophy as a development team.We believe players can choose to play any available hero during any game at any time, and that their choice of hero alone is not a behavior that should be penalized by our customer service team under any of the player report categories (including griefing, inactivity, or poor teamwork).We believe players should be evaluated based on their actions with whichever hero they choose.

I hope this gives players a more clear view on what is reportable and what is not. As long as the person is trying to win I don't really see anything wrong with playing a specific hero, but if the person is negatively impacting the game on any hero it they should deserve to be reported. Quite frankly I find it ridiculous that people could be banned by report abuse for only playing a hero."

I wanted to make this post cause it seems ridiculous that for however long this has been going on, they've had little to no change in viability outside of their majorly agreed niche: Mei as an off-tank, Sombra as an off-support, and Symmetra as a defense hero. History of The TrifectaFor an entire year, Mei has been considered ""F-tier"" since her niche only functions either stall a point at the end of overtime, or to slow enemies that have no movement or protection abilities of any kind: Zenyatta, Roadhog, Ana, Bastion, Torjborn, McCree (kindof). That's only 6 heroes that don't have any real capacity to evade her freeze, and the ones that don't have some sort of damage output to make it hard to even Mei to freeze said heroes. It is especially bad when her only form of range is a projectile that is in fact the ONLY projectile subjected to fall off damage. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwC6QVpn8MkAfter the Ana issue with her becoming the new OP and Must-Pick, the developers have become wary of any incident like that happening again when releasing a new hero. As such, Sombra had the most underwhelming reveal and hasn't moved in popularity and winrate for her entire existence since. Not to mention the fact that she has - and still is - riddled with bugs that detriment her kit overall with so many ability delays and has a ridiculously large spread in her primary that can't compete with other DPS like Soldier or Tracer. Symmetra long ago had the unique mechanic of Photon Shield, which gave allies permanent shield health until the targeted ally died, this was toned down immensely since it meant heroes with 150hp at the time like Tracer, Genji, and Zenyatta were able to benefit from Sym overall. While Symmetra wasn't considered OP, she was a bi-product of a combo that was considered OP. It was at this point that they flat out changed it to an ultimate and filled the Ability slot for Photon Barrier, which not only has a niche usage, but can' really compare to the original strength of Photon Shield. Even then and now, you can't really consider Symmetra over any healer since they have better utility overall. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdirotiA9hshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7n-1sEoZHQUPosted by SilentStormThe Trifecta's design their downfallMei has a projectile fall off, intentionally making her horrible in far range where she lacks. Mei's Ice Wall intentionally is a troll ability by design since your team can't see through the wall which makes it a detriment to your team if they can't see what's going on. Comparing to Reaper, he has a CC immune ability that allows him to move for 3 seconds and is able to reload to have the upper hand; a Mei gets stuck in place, doesn't reload, and no protection to ward people from swarming your Cryofreeze. If they're not gonna add anything to it, they should at least decrease the cooldown. Sombra has a delay to go in and out of Stealth, incredibly weak threshold on her abilities, long as cooldown on Hack and Stealth to make her unable to actually be ready to use them, and a ridiculously large spread that makes her the worst in terms of reliable DPS. Not to mention the bug issue, you can't expect me to believe that Sombra is comparably reliable to a Soldier or Tracer. Symmetra's turret has a 1.4 casting time, 10 meter dmg range, 25% speed reduction that can stack, with a 10 second cooldown with each turret, all of which have 1 HP. First of all, no one finds it fun to have a turret nest at a choke or in a room, not the enemy, not even the Sym player as it is mind-numblingly boring to do so. Secondly, having all of your turrets nested around a choke hitting 1 person is easily 120 dps with a 150% speed reduction; IF all do hit without being destroyed, and that is a big IF, cause most tanks can easily take them out, and with the newly added Moira can easily destroy the nest without hassle with her Biotic Orb and Grasp. Thirdly, it takes 30 seconds to build 3 new turrets, that is the same cooldown as a Mercy Rez, I'm not here to believe that bringing back someone from the dead is as important as building 3 1HP turrets.Lastly, Torbjorn has a better utility with his singular turret since his have 150 instant health that can gain 150+ health and damage more with a constant range of 40 meters. And with her Photon Barrier, the shape of the shield only helps if you're moving forward in chokes, it doesn't protect you from the sides nor behind; it doesn't have a very strong purpose other than to protect quick ults or to protect yourself, but even then you have a ridiculously long cooldown of 10 seconds that supposed to move without any control; a lot can easily happen in under 10 seconds that would be hard to protect.To sum it up, I can't expect to believe something as unreliable as these abilities with a big cooldown would help my team and myself in any non-niche way.Developer Recognition and AcknowledgmentMei's megathread on page 69 got acknowledgement of the fact that the page is being monitored, but many can agree that waiting over 2 weeks for anything else than that is not enough.

These three heroes are in fact THE only heroes that haven't had a prominent change for basically their entire existence, always at the bottom of the barrel in comp picks. These heroes at their current state won't be taken seriously and would STILL be picked in comp for 2 reasons: to be taken seriously with the hero and use them in their proper niche, OR to use them purposely in poor situations to use as a throw pick.

https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760716848,The Trifecta of Extremely Niche Heroes,NA,"The Trifecta's design their downfallMei has a projectile fall off, intentionally making her horrible in far range where she lacks. Mei's Ice Wall intentionally is a troll ability by design since your team can't see through the wall which makes it a detriment to your team if they can't see what's going on. Comparing to Reaper, he has a CC immune ability that allows him to move for 3 seconds and is able to reload to have the upper hand; a Mei gets stuck in place, doesn't reload, and no protection to ward people from swarming your Cryofreeze. If they're not gonna add anything to it, they should at least decrease the cooldown. Sombra has a delay to go in and out of Stealth, incredibly weak threshold on her abilities, long as cooldown on Hack and Stealth to make her unable to actually be ready to use them, and a ridiculously large spread that makes her the worst in terms of reliable DPS. Not to mention the bug issue, you can't expect me to believe that Sombra is comparably reliable to a Soldier or Tracer. Symmetra's turret has a 1.4 casting time, 10 meter dmg range, 25% speed reduction that can stack, with a 10 second cooldown with each turret, all of which have 1 HP. First of all, no one finds it fun to have a turret nest at a choke or in a room, not the enemy, not even the Sym player as it is mind-numblingly boring to do so. Secondly, having all of your turrets nested around a choke hitting 1 person is easily 120 dps with a 150% speed reduction; IF all do hit without being destroyed, and that is a big IF, cause most tanks can easily take them out, and with the newly added Moira can easily destroy the nest without hassle with her Biotic Orb and Grasp. Thirdly, it takes 30 seconds to build 3 new turrets, that is the same cooldown as a Mercy Rez, I'm not here to believe that bringing back someone from the dead is as important as building 3 1HP turrets.Lastly, Torbjorn has a better utility with his singular turret since his have 150 instant health that can gain 150+ health and damage more with a constant range of 40 meters. And with her Photon Barrier, the shape of the shield only helps if you're moving forward in chokes, it doesn't protect you from the sides nor behind; it doesn't have a very strong purpose other than to protect quick ults or to protect yourself, but even then you have a ridiculously long cooldown of 10 seconds that supposed to move without any control; a lot can easily happen in under 10 seconds that would be hard to protect.To sum it up, I can't expect to believe something as unreliable as these abilities with a big cooldown would help my team and myself in any non-niche way."

There's going to be ten times as many &lt;insert viable hero here&gt; mains being top500 as well, because some heroes are stronger/more efficient than others.If you want a comparison, there is going to be a martial artist somewhere who can kick your and my butt at the same time, with a hand behind his back.

Chu admits that they've told very little about Reaper's backstory, and Kaplan himself stated back in May 2017 that there is still much more about Reaper's story that they want to tell. So a future Reaper's comic, novel or animated short is not far-fetched at all.And yes, i do remember when the Uprising event was released, i freaked out upon hearing Gabriel Reyes' younger voice... in a positive way, of course. I also find ironic that Reaper's voice actor, Keith Ferguson, is actually a very nice person in real life! He is an amazing voice actor, because he can do Reaper's soothing and supernatural voice without any filter, and can also do Reyes' younger voice."

The drawback to rez WAS NEEDED it is too powerful of an ability to just let it be an instant rez with no drawbacks outside of ult....Its like having a 1 shot button on a 30 sec cd....it was just as bad for the game....5 man rez WASN'T too horrible but it was annoying at the end of a game where it really became an almost IWIN button.

Her rez on cooldown is still too strong, even if you only use it in valk. This just shows that the other healers need a buff to heals per second if they want to compete with mercy. Blizzard also needs to seriously consider how they are going to balance rez as an ability, if that is even possible. I wouldn't say mercy is ""bad"", her cast time has just made her unfun to play, not to mention the toxicity that has arisen out of single rez."

She's easy to hit and can be, frozen, halt'd, concussive blasted, hooked, hacked, punched, boostered, booped, sleep darted and charged away from the target, cancelling the ability. It's a lot to deal with as the Mercy, not to mention avoiding flankers. Somehow it all comes down to the cool down and the lack of things to do if it were longer. Valkerie also makes people mad as you can fly so far you're hard to hit or even impossible to hit for many heroes. I don't have a solution to this but that's what I've understood so far."

People claiming that it will always make Mercy a must-have clearly missed the tank aka Ana meta.What killed Ana was Winstons buff and the dive meta that followed.So I agree that resurrect could be balanced - it was.  The offensive options being op is why the meta began favoring high mobility and the ability to resurrect instagibbed allies.Having said that, old resurrect was a complaint for many, but really it was because it felt bad when it countered your efforts.  When a big resurrect had that impact, it generally meant the offense screwed up and blew all their ultimates.  Rather than accept that, they cried until it was removed.And hide and seek Mercy was usually a losing strategy.  Most good Mercy players didnt hide, they avoided being caught in ultimates, while supporting their team 99% of the time.Ironically, I now find myself hiding far more than ever to avoid rip tires every 30 seconds, as theres no other way to avoid it reliably."

But she's not fun to play. She's literally just a rez bot now. On top of that her ultimate literally takes away any strategic requirements that she use to have. You don't need to stay in range of your target, you regen health, you don't need to prioritize healing targets, and you don't have to position well because you can be anywhere as long as it's within LoS and heal someone.The new Mercy has replaced the old Lucio for me as the most boring healer.

I'd increase the charge rate. In terms of base damage I don't really see the fuss, Pharah is a carbon copy just more rockets and better mobility. A decent hitscan should be able to take Junkrat out fast the problem is it's a team game and getting 1v1 is difficult so the misconception is he is OP when in reality the ultimate is the problem."

So its infuriating when a random grenade hits you from no where near the action because of spamming. That said 120 with no drop off is a joke, not even Pharah can manage that consistency and she doesnt even get rebounds. Plus the fact splash manages that damage also, is further bs. Especially now he gets double mines.Theres been a few games where my team is being smashed, just outright being out played and ive switched to JR and completely stalled their progress and manage multiple kills via fluke rather than intent.

https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760726211?page=2#post-25,Can we get a console nerf for Junkrat?,NA,"He's fine on the console as he is on the PC - I suspect someone asking for a console nerf thinks he is OP on PC as wellThere is nothing about console gameplay that makes Junkrat more dominant - console benefits evasion since it is harder to look as quickly - Junkrat isn't like Tracer or Genji in that respectI post this whenever someone states or implies Junkrat gets too much for his effort:While really low level players may be able to pick up Junkrat and do ok in a silver match, being successful in higher ranks takes as much or more skill than other herosRemember that hitscan aim is not the be-all-end-all of skill in OverwatchA good Junkrat uses the mines to move effectively, but it takes more skill to move efficiently with the mine than it takes to teleport around or spam a double jump with the ability to climb walls - in fact Junkrat's mobility option takes away from his close-ranged firepower to use - something other heros don't have to worry about with their mobility optionsJunkrat must choose where to lay his traps and where to throw bombs when he is using indirect support - he needs to manage the push and pull to decide when to advance and engage directly or even flank or instead apply indirect pressure/area denial - the better Junkrats seem to have a ""psychic"" sense of where someone is going to go and will already have a mine ready'Hitting with grenades from a distance directly isn't easy - it is a slow projectile and it's arc, like Mei's delay is just one more thing to have to take into account when aimingWhen his opponents are not stupidly feeding, the rat player needs to be canny and smart in order to maintain impact comparable to simply taking Tracer or GenjiAs stated, grenade spam he could always do - back when he was solidly F-tier - You mitigate it by using a dynamic, fast-moving playstyle - he hurts turtlers - push through that choke right away with Lucio's speed boost instead of stupidly lingering in the choke, vainly hoping to get a 2+ elim advantage or a tank kill on the other team before moving in - also don't blindly rush through the most obvious doorway without any protection - IRL military/police training calls doorways ""Fatal Funnels"" for a reasonAs for the mine - he can't double mine you unless you come to him - if he mine jumps over to you and then hits you with a grenade to the face followed by a mine for the kill then he used the 2nd mine for mobility just like his detractors wantSeriously, just kill him from outside of mine range - like if Genji actually kill him entirely with ranged shuirkens rather than relying on triple shuriken to the face and or swift-strike like a crutch - you know, use that ""skill"" that Genji mains are always yammering aboutYes, this means the best move may be to not approach a control point or a payload until Junkrat has been killed or you have a team push with a numbers advantage - it's comparable to how D.Va suppresses certain ults until she has been de-meched"

Smurfing gives them relief, they dont feel any responsibility because they dont care about SR. And, funny thing, you cant report the guy who doesnt care about SR/outcome of the match because its not detectable!!! Smurfing ruins the whole competitive spirit, which actually defines competitive mode among other modes. THIS IS SO HUGE fail from Blizzard and their development team.

I bought the game on pc to escape this very problem. I never played an fps on pc ever on my entire life, and I am being constantly stomped on pc. But I know I will improve.One possible solution to consoles, at least to reduce the astounding number of smurfs, is to require a link to a battle.net account with a game purchased on it. Give an option to register your console disc to ONE AND ONLY ONE specific battlenet, or, if you bought it digitally,  to only that account once you link you psn/xbla account with a battle.net account. This way, you would need to buy the game again on consoles to be a smurf.Take Fortnite for example, Epic Games requires psn and xbla accounts to make and link to an Epic account, so they can control this kinda problem with no difficulties."

When you can and do significantly change rank on a smurf vs your main account its no surprise theres a massive increase in smurfs. They did it for season 2 and not again since which is stupid. I dont know another game (please, let me know) that doesnt reset each season and starts you from where you left off minus a 100+sr.While I do like this idea, not everyone would like if they had to start all over.But to me this sounds like a great solution.True, itll likely upset a few people but like I said, I dont know a game that doesnt do a reset, when other major games do I dont get why OW doesnt. Plus those that get really upset over it would likely be those that are likely carried and riding past season highs, as to paraphrase an argument thrown around alot ""if youre good, youll climb"" thus if youre a good player, youll get a good rank. A hard reset would have a !@#$show in MM, whilst a soft would maintain MM in that you should be placing against people of the same level from last season and losses will have you face lower ranks and wins would have you facing higher ranks etc. Point being, as it stands seasons are irrelevant and serve no purpose other than to give the devs some maintenance time or whatever hence theyre like 2-3 days gap between seasons. Sort seasons out and I bet youll see less smurfs."

Because smurfing and throwing are two COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THINGS.  Any valid argument against smurfing would have absolutely nothing to do with throwing, so the word ""throw"" should not appear in your post.In case you're still oblivious, every single thread that has ever been made complaining about smurfs is actually complaining about behavior that anyone can and DOES do, regardless of smurfing or not: throwing, deranking, boosting, toxicity, etc.  Yes, maybe a larger percentage of smurfs do it than non-smurfs, but it's not the actual problem.  Fix the throwing, deranking, boosting, toxicity, etc, and you have nothing left to complain about, because THAT'S THE ACTUAL ISSUE.  Smurfs are just your scapegoat.bullsh*t.a ton of posts are about people being tired of completely outclassed by smurfs in their own rank. THAT'S what people are tired of, stop trying to make it seem like it's not a huge issue in certain ranks.and contrary to what you're defending, as i'm sure you're playing a smurf yourself, as there's no other reason anyone would defend this nonsense, smurfs throw a lot easier because they have less to care about."

Having 22 hours in QP with Genji while being a Silver Portrait 2 star doesn't make me a Genji player. I suck with him.Look at the characters that have an advantage in a fight with Genji.-Mcree-Soldier-Winston-Pharah-Moira-Tracer-Zarya-Doomfist (once ALL his bugs are fixed)-JunkratThat's a decent amount of the cast. For some reason people will argue they don't have an advantage which still baffles me. Mcree is a good example.Deflect doesn't give Genji the advantage here. It can't when the Genji doesn't have the ride of way here. Mcree doesn't have to Flashbang until after Deflect is used. If he doesn't Deflect then you will just kill him. Baiting the Deflect with Mcree is super easy. You can by landing one shot on him which usually forces the Deflect or Melee to fake the Flashbang. You can even flash above or at his feet and be successful. If you get a Flashbang deflected back in your face it's almost always your fault.So I don't understand it.People like to say if he is good enough he has no counters. That's an outlier. I'm a Hanzo main. I have no counters at all if I'm on my game. That doesn't make Hanzo OP.

Somewhere around diamond is where the average players accuracy is good enough to keep up with all the jumping and dashing he does.  Meanwhile dash and right click require less mechanical aim to use effectively, so below a certain skill threshold Genji has a decent advantage.I somewhat disagree here. Most fights with Genji at lower ranks is when he is jumping around throwing stars at you. When he is just jumping around he is super predictable to land shots on. Falling to the ground always makes you predictable. That's why jumping all the times isn't advised. I'm a low Diamond/High Plat player most days. I don't see the issue."

First off. Junkrats mines. Genji can deflect but still take the full damage by air bursting it before it reaches him. A mind deflected back at you is a user error. Junkrats trap is great against flankers including Genji. It's a great way to shut them down especially if they are targeting certain heroes like healers. Put the trap in the back line where the healers hang out and you can trap Genji back there pretty consistently. Same for Tracer. The mines are the real reason though. Junkrat is Anti dive for a reason."

So she's pretty remarkable. I don't know that she fits the mold. Then again, Overwatch specialized in finding the best of the best, so it's no surprise there. The problem overall is that Overwatch was filled with the best and brightest.

But almost all of them are ""The Best"" or super-special in some way. You've got Mercy and Moira who are both ""Best docter evar"" and Winston and Mei, the ""best scientists"". There are 3 people who are the best marksman, there's the best architect, the best musician, the best starcraft 2 player, and the best bodybuilder. You've got the best hacker, the best pilot, the best soldier, the best robot, the best heist crew, the best ninja and the best engineer.Bastion is pretty much the one exception to this, but he's just a lovable pile of bolts hellbent on petting animals and watching grass grow. So I guess he's the best at that, since nobody else does what he does.I guess what i'm trying to say is that nobody is really just some guy caught up in it all, someone to blend into the woodwork, the unmemorable middleman. Overwatch was made up of the best of the best, but Overwatch isn't around anymore. The world is troubled, and the common man just sits around presumably eating bits of sticks and scratching their heads as the world falls apart around them, and I keep asking myself, why? I propose that the next hero isn't that at all. Just someone to walk off after a fight that they didn't really want to be in. He doesn't have some flashy call-sign, or elegant old name. Just some dude with a gun who wants to go on with his life. All of his skins would just be like him wearing different t-shirts, his legendary would be just the same guy but wearing a hoodie or coat.That or an old-man in a red waistcoat who smokes a pipe and uses bees as a weapon. And not something stupid like Holo-future bees, if Ana can put a sleep-dart through 3-inches of advanced German armor or into a soulless machine, bees can kill Bastion."

I mean Blizz shouldn't even defend him on this since he is a toxic player. Someone like this doesn't belong in comp since not just do they hog the Top 500 slots, but also pollutes the game's community with toxicity by promoting this behavior. I believe his alts should be stripped of their Top 500 rank and just be GM without rank. He even admitted to which are his meaning that we know which to strip. I mean it's not like he should be scared of losing Top 500 on his main anyways. He may as well earn it since he can. I believe multiple Top 500 accounts per person shouldn't be a thing and that only one account should compete for a slot. I also believe big streamers like Calvin should be made an example of for calling people who complain about this ""retards."" He represents the game as much as the pros do. He's the one who partnered up with Twitch and decided to represent Overwatch. There for he should represent the game instead of staining its name. Leave your thoughts on this matter for I'm curious how others feel about this issue. SteevO was made an example for doing Bronze to GM runs, xQc was made an example of false reporting, and Dafran was made as the ultimate example of throwing. So I say let AimbotCalvin be our next example of toxicity for his selfish and close minded mentality of thinking he's better than others and treating people like they're beneath him.p.s.

With competitive rewards Blizzard did a great job specifying, before the mode was even added, that Competitive Player Icons and sprays would always be limited time, forever missable items. They are consistent and self explanatory. It's hard to confuse that an icon or spray aptly named 'Season 5 Contender' will ever be available again. A simple icon named Red Envelope, though? Or one named 2017? No indication in their names, images, or tooltip that they will be removed from next year's loot boxes. Prior to clicking this thread, I'm sure very few people even considered that the Red Envelope icon was already removed. But it probably is. That shows how inconsistent these removed icons are in comparison to the competitive rewards."

Bragging is neither here nor there. I've always been fine with permanently missable collectors items; it's Blizzard's approach that I find strange this time around. Blizzard likes to showcase how transparent they are with their community, and they usually are, but removing items from loot boxes without so much as mentioning it in the patch notes I find meaner than the usual Blizzard status quo.Plus the removed player icons in question were implemented before the Lootbox recoding earlier this year. One could have played every day of Winter Wonderland and Chinese New Year and never got either icon. There's nothing wrong with tough luck.

I will admit, that I am not completely innocent in the issue. I don't try to start any, but my response to toxicity isn't always the best. xQc to me is a child. He is very toxic, in team chat and when he gets fed up he's been reported to throw. He's given out false reports because he doesn't like how people play, and the one time I watched his stream to see just how bad he was, he was seen yelling at his team to  do what he wanted, and they still lost the point. He then went to call out a teammate who, from my observation was actually trying, for throwing. Now I am not T500, nor do I even play comp that much (I only have 68 hours in it compared to almost 800 in quick). I am a casual player, but I am a support main so looking at everything at once is just what I do, and xQc is good, but he is a very self-centered player. I can say, that toxicity only breeds more toxicity. Yelling quickly in the microphone because something isn't going his way, brings the entire team down, everyone gets just as fed up as he does, and could end with people just muting him completely. I can say, that if I was on his team I'd mute him. I can't stand people back-seat playing my character. Still, a ""Don't worry we got this next round"" helps team moral a lot more than yelling."

Tracer is simply that overpowered in the current state of the gameAs for Genji, he just has way to many ways to escape from Mei. The slow projectile speed of Mei's primary fire makes it a nightmare to actually connect and freeze him when he's spamming double jump, and on top of that, Genji has his dash which takes him well out of range of Mei, while also going in any direction the Genji chooses. Luckily if the Genji messes up his dash, there's nothing much he can do against you."

Which it does not.But what if it could?They would simply avoid her and tanks would get destroyed by it. Winston, DVA, Reinhardt (loses charge). And an ability like that is completely busted. That's what Sombra hack is supposed to do but it isn't unconditional. You need to get the hack through.Giving someone an ability that essentially acts like a mini-flashbang with no cooldown that's always available is beyond busted.And it will never happen."

I promise you that is not true, believe me I felt the same way when I first started, but it does get better.Another thing I would like to mention is that often times it is not your lack of skill or the lack of skill of each player on your team, but the lack of teamwork and cooperation between each player on the team. It is also worth mentioning that trying to force players to cooperate or trying to force a good team composition will never help, it will only make things worse and make the teamwork and cooperation decay faster.So just remember to be polite, try to be as kind as possible to your team, even if they do not return that kindness. Every little bit you can do to show your team that you are willing to cooperate helps, and every little bit of that make things get easier.Also, I am not sure about it being against the law to share video proof of something like this. You are allowed to give sources to help move along your discussion, so I do not see why this is any different.

Her healing potential is actually higher. Mercy can just heal more consistently and that's why she usually gets gold healing over Ana."

The concept of placements statistically is to correct misjudgements by the system. More precisely, you start in your previous season SR initially, but there's more uncertainty i.e. SR volatility. As you do your placements, the system tries to determine your most suited SR and as the placements pass, the system becomes more certain. In other words, there's a different outcome of losing 4 and then winning 6, with winning 4, losing 2, winning 2 and then losing 2. The degrees of freedom (uncertainty) decrease match by match, therefore the SR given/lost changes as well."

The damage buff was cool but I would take that back for a radius buff. As long as they keep the healing the same so is doesn't encourage the tank meta again it should be fine I believe.

It might be a great ULT counter but put two flankers in the field and Ana's pretty much hard countered. If you sleep one then his brother will kill you. Guardian-Anger is so much a better self defense than she has. I wish she had something better to evade with than a wonky dart on a long cool down.

But this is just my thoughts and it'd kinda make logical sense when you come to think about it.In Moira's origin story, we're gifted with bits of information that relate to her experiments, mainly one that presents Gabriel Reyes looking at himself in awe while black-like smoke slither off his body, perhaps displaying his ability to wraith and shadow step. This would explain his power without relating to the fact that he got them when he died. Imagine it, Reaper, McCree, Genji and Moira in their Blackwatch related skins fighting off Omnics or any other type of enemy, just like in the Uprising mode. Now the biggest concern with this is that there's three offence heroes and one healer. In Uprising, we had the choice of one of each role. Tracer, Torbjörn, Reinhardt and Mercy. Now I can only assume that the map layout and game-mode will function through teamwork while causing havoc. Also, think of the interactions and the witty banter they'll share with each other.Obviously, I can't confirm nothing, this was just a thought that I had in mind of what might come in the future. But hey, fingers crossed..."

https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760766446,PTR Testing - Movement Changes,12/18/2017 22:53,"Hi all,Were making a change on our PTR servers shortly (no patch required!), that reworks some of how our heroes move and accelerate. This was originally done to fix bugs on a couple heroes, but the changes are systemic and affect all Heroes.   Specifically, movement on the ground is much more consistent. Going up/down inclines will no longer affect the Heros speed.  Previously, inclines could either make you move slightly faster or slightly slower, depending on the circumstances. Inclines will also no longer cause a small amount of strafing movement when moving diagonally on them.   A side effect of these changes is characters will now have slightly better air control.   For example, Winston previously was not able to easily make small adjustments to his flight path during his Jump Pack leap, but now he should be able to do that, and it is also noticeable on many of the other Heroes that are often in the air.We think these changes will overall be great improvements but there might be some unintended side effects that wed love your help finding on the PTR!Thanks!"

She also cannot multitask the way Lucio or Zenyatta can, she has to put her healing away to shoot her pistol.Zenyatta lacks mobility because he is a very offensive healer. That's how he's balanced.

https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760766812,Support Self-Healing Unfairness,12/22/2017 6:54,"I've always wondered this, and am now adding it into my thoughts with Moira about all the supports' self-healing abilities. This is excluding ultimates.Mercy heals 20hp/s after a one-second buffer.Moira heals through damaging, at 33hp/s, or with her 10-second CD orb that does 75hp/s for a maximum of 300 HP healed in total/heals any ally near it who is damaged.Lucio heals for 12hp/s only with the correct song which has a .8-second CD to swap between the two, and does 35hp/s for three seconds on a 12-second CD.Zenyatta heals 30 shields/second after not taking damage for three seconds. This cannot heal his 50 hp, only his 150 shields.Ana can only heal herself with her grenade that has a 10-second CD, and it heals 100hp for anyone within the radius of it, but also damages enemies, buffs healing recieved for all allied targets and prevents enemies from receiving any form of healing for four seconds.Symmetra has less shields than Zenyatta, with 100, only able to heal 30hp/s after not getting hit for three seconds._____Now, I'm wondering this: why does Mercy ( and now Moira ) have such overpowered self-healing compared to the other supports? I'm probably one of the only people that want Moira's self-healing through her damage nerfed ( preferably halved, that way it's between Mercy and shields in some sense ), Mercy's self-healing nerfed ( and not work how it does in her ult, just keep it the same normally ), and Ana, Zenyatta and Lucio's self-healing buffed.I suggest that Mercy's self healing change to two second wait time for 10 or 15hp/s ( and not always heal during her ult ). People argue that ""she's a support, she has no defense by herself and needs it"". This is false. She has a gun, she has teammates. Just because she's in a solo situation by herself does not automatically mean she's allowed to have the most powerful healing in the game. Put anyone else in that situation. They work out just fine, and so can Mercy, but she has more self-healing instead of damage, despite her damage still being pretty decent.Preferably I'd like Ana to have something similar to Mercy's self-healing, but on a nerfed scale, and her grenade's healing and damage nerfed a bit, but keep the cooldown the same. Ana has self-healing on a ten-second cooldown, and she must choose to either use it on herself, an enemy, or her teammates. This is ridiculous.Lucio's self-healing is a constant passive so long as he has his healing up and not his speed boost. He doesn't even get healed for as much as he can heal others, and I have to wonder why this is.Moira should not heal for as much as she does. ""Requiring aim for her to heal"" is not a trade-off argument in this situation, because she HAS to aim in order to get her primary ally healing back. With a little bit of practice it seems anyone can play her pretty well; she's easy to pick up and is a main healer like Mercy, but with much more damage and self-healing. Her orb is fine in my opinion because she, like Ana, has to choose on damage or healing, but this, too, can be sucked up by D.Va or reflected by Genji, but at least she can just automatically start sucking the life out of enemies for her own self-healing, and on a massive scale. She's barely a support, she's basically just a hybrid of Soldier and Symmetra with Zenyatta's shtick of harmony/discord and orbs. I'm probably one of the only people that want her nerfed.Zenyatta and Symmetra are a different matter entirely. Neither of them can fully heal themselves, and must wait three seconds without being hit to even start the process. You get hit? Good luck, another three seconds. They have no mobility. Zenyatta has it even less than Symmetra does in some sense because Symmetra has a shield ability she can throw out, and her turrets for some protection, but Zen does not. There's clear differences between the two and that's damage and support ability; Symmetra buffs teams, Zenyatta debuffs enemies. Their damage is similar, but Zen without his orb does more, has range, but is projectile VS Symmetra's ( knowingly-bugged ) lock-on beam that cannot be reflected or headshot. The pair need something that isn't shields for self-healing. It would feel wrong giving both of them something that isn't shields in my opinion; Zen could have an auto-repair thing like Bastion does, and Symmetra could just have self-healing like Mercy, but still give shields with her ult. Hell, you could even let Zenyatta orb himself, but then that'd be a similar situation to Ana: self or ally.Just my quickly thought-up two cents.TL;DR- Nerf Moira and Mercy self-healing.- Give Ana and Symmetra similar regen qualities like Mercy and remove Symmetra's starting shields in favor of just pure HP.- Have Lucio's self-healing buffed.- Remove Zenyatta's shields and add pure HP, and give him a self-repair like Bastion, or let him orb himself."
https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760766812,Support Self-Healing Unfairness,NA,"Let me just lay it down as it is.Yes, Mercy gets full hp after 11 seconds of staying out of combat if she has 1hp left, but it is interupted by any and all damage. Let's not forget it takes a whole second to heal 20hp, it's only 1 hp more than a 76 bullet. Provided you can shoot her every second she won't regenerate hp.Yes, Moira get 33 hp/s, but literally any dps worth their salt can kill her faster than she can regenerate. If she has her Orb up. Retreat, swallow your pride and fall back. Don't want her to regen hp? Attack from behind a shield, she'll either have to get past the shield, waste her orb or run. And she can't take 2 people on at once alone.Yes, Ana gets 100 hp/nade and the nade takes 10 seconds to cooldown. BUT the nade is a game changing ability as it can block all healing for 3 seconds. (except shield regen)  and can deny Life saving healing and can add a 1.5* multiplier to allied healing which is huge. If she didn't have to use it to heal herself, the effect would be staggering.Zenyatta has shields as He's a combat/dps hybrid along with Moira. Both have 30hp/s healing as they're expected to dip in and out  of combat frequently having toned down healing would lower his uptimes as he's already slow and very weak to dive.Lucio has weak healing as he has plenty of other tools to escape his enemies. He can speed away after booping enemies and wallriding further increases his ability to escape. Compare and contrast to Moira who only has 1 fade on a 6 second CD and almost every DPS has a way of keeping up with her should they decide to give chase but has a stronger 33hp/s healing to compensate.Lastly there's Symmetra. She's nothing special, not a trained war veteran, doesn't have any special healing technology to patch her up. Her Shields and Light constructs are all she has. Removing her shield hp and replacing it with normal hp would not only change a large part if the character it would also make her less susceptible to sombra's EMP, which counters a dispropotionately large part of her kit already as though they designed Sombra to counter Symmetra."

I agree that at gold and below her skill floor allows her to 1v1 easier, but in plat any dps can kill her easily. Her orb needs to not focus syms turrents, that's it.I don't think OP supports that Moira is OP in 1v1, in comparison with other supports. Moira along with an out of cds Ana need the most time to duel as a flanker. However, Ana needs her cooldowns to duel, while Moira not; In tight maps, like the controls, it's almost impossible to kill her (given that her team has awareness). She just needs a tremendous time to be killed, so she doesn't worth the time. It's better to kill fast other key targets like junkrat (for the shields), the second healer etc. Second she is the only support that can cheat death from dedicated flanker (Tracer and Genji) ulties with her teleport.IMO, Moira will be nerfed for sure, no matter how much we argue in favour or against her. The reason is simple; her competitive winning rates are just too high for a new hero and she has unreal average stats (combo of high elims, final blows, healing and low deaths). She is 4th (platinum stats) in Eliminations over Deaths ratio behind from D.Va, Torb and Zarya. DVa and Torb were always in the E:D first places due to their mechanics and survability.After examining the stats I wonder: Should a support have a place there? As you already know there are a lot of topics about Genji's and Tracer's survivability, but Moira is in a better position right now.There are a lot of people around who believe that Moira is fine. Can you support your arguments through statistics? Stats are objective facts, while ""a Tracer can kill Moira"" is very subjective, because this is a 6v6 game and not a 1v1 deathmatch. In papers, Tracer deals exactly 400 dmg with 1 clip if she only headshots. Have you ever seen a double kill against 2 full health dps with 1 clip? That's why stats matter."

Self healing is not the only factor in survivability. Keep in mind, Symmetra and Zennyatta have significantly more damage the the others. Becoming quasi-DPS at times. A spatially aware Zennyata with decent aim can RMB one shot characters chasing them down, especially around corners and chokes. Meanwhile Symmetra's laser does a significant amount of damage, on top of her area denial with turrets, killing the Symmetra is not always as easy as you might think. Their self defense capabilities I think make up for their lower sustained healing. Also, Ana has her sleep dart. If she is getting dived or harassed, you can just sleep them. Yes, she has less self healing, but her shutdown potential makes up for that in my opinion. Also, Moira has to get very close to the enemy for her self healing, often that can be very risky, if the enemy team is dive heavy. For instance, yes your regenerating 33 hp/s, which is quite good. But if you have a Tracer diving you, you'll still die in a couple seconds, if that. That said, mercy's self heal seems a bit copious comparatively. Perhaps make it 2 seconds before it starts?

I played with a team where most of the males were probably 12 or 13 today and maybe one male was their Dad (guessing but could be wrong)... They were more respectful than 90% of the males I have witnessed ingame. That is pretty sad.  Adult males or even post pubescent males should know better.

https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760766874,Does Winston counter Genji?,NA,"Hard counter? Well if Winston hard counters Genji, he ultra hard ultimate counters Sym, since he can basically obliterate her and her constructs at will, and needs serious misplay to lose against her.It's kinda true that in term of characters able to keep Genji in check, he's likely the most competent, and will force him at minimum to either stay at range, be careful with his cooldowns, or very confident that he can take down someone fast enough to get a dash reset before he's in trouble. To compare with other beam chars, like Zar, Mei, or Sym, he just has to not get close to them, and since they have no mobility, it's not a hard task .Edit: forgot Moira, who very likely does a nice job of defending herself against Genji (who naturally targets healers), and whose strong heals might help allies against his burst (maybe). Her orbs are also perfect for the times he's backing off into a building, although whether or not wasting a cooldown to maybe get him is another choice to make."

Even for Winston, Genji's hardest counter, neither is true. Instead, for him (and Tracer) the definition is amended. ""You're not supposed to kill him.

He has better range than Winston.  And once Genji has his ult (which he can build by peppering Winston from afar), Winston isn't even a threat unless he has his ult (which he probably won't if all he's doing is babysitting the back line from Genji).Basically, Winston is Genji's hardest counter, but he's certainly not a hard counter, at least not as the term applies to other characters."

If its defense then you shouldn't be diving a lot of the time.Winston jump CD is shorter than genji dash, also most winstons don't waste their jump needlessly. If the genji is an idiot enough to dash into your team you jump on him and you will have jump before he has dash and should be an easy pick. If he tries walking to your team so can you and you should be closer to your team anyway, case of wasting dash. You have a shield, that stops his ult charging. If you aren't diving you should have this up.A lot of people here think that you have to be killing genji as winston... you don't.

You're assuming that all people beyond yourself have an equally likely chance of leaving a game, and that only one person will leave the game during its match. This in and of itself is flawed logic as anyone who has ever been in a match with a leaver knows that other people can also leave during the match. However, let's ignore that. Your supposition is that for every leaving match there are 11 members who might leave. 6 out of those 11 members on the opposing team. 5 out of those 11 on your team. Or (because you were not kind enough to calculate your own proofs) there is a 54.5% chance of the leaver being on the opposite team and a 45.5% chance of that leaver being on your team. (Those are good odds for a casino, bad odds for just about anything else.)Of course,  your argument also hinges on the belief that oneself will never be the leaver. This is statistically dodgy at best as, should you lose power or connection, you yourself will be the leaver. This makes it back to 50% chance you will be on the leaving team. You cannot discount yourself from a calculation because there is a chance, no matter how slim, that you will be the leaver. And each person similarly has a different chance they will leave a game - whether through a statistically worse internet connection or a habit of leaving. In reality, the odds of you having a leaver on your team would be calculated by each player's individual leaving percentage times the 1/12 chance they will be placed on your team versus another. (Added together to make a full team of course.)This, by the by, is likely to change based on the rank you're in, what server you are playing in, and other factors. TL;DR: No. It isn't. Your premise and math is faulty. Signed - a former Senior Statistical Analysis manager."

""It doesn't translate into the real world that well."" That is why. I duo queue, so according to his ""math"" I have an even less likely chance of encountering leavers on my team. However, in my experience this season, I have encountered more ""leavers"" on my team. If you consider that most of them returned and were therefore disconnects, I have encountered an equal amount of leavers. That does not add up in the most basic of examples weighed in his favor. That is why people dislike it, it is literally a waste of time even humoring this conclusion that weights exactly one variable. If you pass your opinion off as fact and hide behind a technicality, that is what happens and I am surprised so many sheep actually agree with this juvenile reasoning. People who are not privy to ""ooh, that is technically true"" are going to call out the fallacy because it is not true. There are literally hundreds upon thousands of variables to consider at the end of the day. Ending the story at, ""you are not going to leave, so that means they might be more likely to leave"" is erroneous af.Beyond that, let us go into the delusional mind of a Junkrat main and for one second pretend that this drivel is actually objective fact. In this fantasy land where 2 + 2 = 6 and this guy confirmed the math, so it must be true, leavers are more likely on the enemy team. And that leaves us with a big so what? Who cares? That is not going to make me feel better when my wins and losses are invalidated because someone left. Free win, free loss, it does not matter. In the case of a free win, I get 15 out of 3000 competitive points and in the case of the free loss, I go down in SR and wait until they get a leaver to bring it back up to neutral. My point is that his, um... observation (I am tired of alluding to this half-baked assumption as math) means nothing. It is of no concern to anyone and most people could deduce this general guideline for themselves. That could be another logical reason for down-votes. It is not even worth considering."

There's a frequency in which it happens. once every 100 players (i dont know the exact number). Etc. You can treat it as a rare event.

Moira is the only hero that can undoubtedly deal with a low to mid tier play Tracer by keeping her at bay with her damage orbs. A real buff(decrease time it takes to freeze targets and reduce time that they stay frozen) to Mei can see her deal with them a lot easier and fill the role as an anti flanker

Otherwise it just turns into a stomp. And to add insult to injury the matchmaking takes way too long to find a game just to have this horrible result.

I actually treat her more as a tank (controlling space, drawing aggro, etc.) I do think becoming an anti flanker is something that would help her a lot. I think overall Mei is in a difficult place, not because she is UP. But because she inconsistent. There is a big thread that details a lot of these inconsistencies. But in terms of her anti-flanking potential, I think a less development intensive way to address the issue is to make her slow debuff kick in earlier and last longer. As it stands most heroes once you get into range with them, they are easily frozen. Getting in range and surviving the enemy team is the difficult part. So extending the time the slow debuff last will have an impact on Tracer and Genji who usually get exposed but swift strike/blink out but everyone else's match up will remain the same."

I screencap everytime this happens, I actually might just start making a folder of frozen tracers. (Or just tracer suffering)When it comes to tracer, I'm obviously relying on my icicle. As I've honed my aim well, I tend to atleast body shot them and force a recall. The really, really good tracers (the gm and top 500 ones I'm currently facing) I've just started playing against... yeah I'm struggling hitting them with MCREE (my other main) lmao.Good tracers are scary, and Mei is inconsistent for tracer even if you've greatly honed your aim. Some games I never hit tracer, while others I'm always headshotting them! They usually switch to pharah and focus me, I still shoot them down tho.Now, as for buffs, people have the absolute wrong idea for Mei I feel. IN FACT most of these suggestions come from people who dont even play Mei or realize her true role, or why Mei isnt the most ideal pick.As buzzinate pointed out, mobility skills should be reduced in terms of speed and distance, not completely removed that's basically hacking your enemy with primary fire. That would make Mei way too good, and then people will bandwagon her, yeah no thanks, don't want my Mei being a mustpick. I prefer the confined community that is being a Mei main. Now, Mei is weighed down due to the heavy gear she wears,  I understand that but I feel her speed could be increased just a bit, for QOL. Nothing major.  Really, Mei just needs minor-median QOL changes, nothing as severe as a rework please. A new ability maybe? Ultimate buffs definetly. Overall Mei just needs the small things, such as primary fire becoming hitscan (literally every other beam is). Icicles should stay the same besides an increased rate of fire. Cyrofreeze could be changed to stall less, but be more efficient such as providing a reload. I HATE people who pick Mei just to stall an inevitable loss, by the way her winrate is negatively impacted by this since people tend to go over that stat often.Mei doesn't need much to be in a better spot, people who suck as mei will still suck. Good meis can enjoy a better experience, and new people should be more welcomed to try out mei. Simple.NOW, as for HARD changes sym is what truly needs looking at, and I say that as someone who hates sym with a passion and loves Mei more than anything else."

Probably discouraging. It's always kind of been this way too, except for when? When Mercy would hide, pop off a huge Rez, and now she was on fire. Psychologically... it feels good.

Hiding wasn't as fun...and fighting a Mercy who just hid, flew in, revived everyone wasn't fun either. What was though, was the intensity to gather enough charge for revive, constantly feeling on edge, healing everyone, damage boosting every ability to get your ult quickly. It made healing more enjoyable. Sometimes, we got POTG too, not always, but sometimes. It was nice...for at least one shining moment a support's love and work for the team was shown.I used to hear in the voice comms wonderful comments whenever I pulled of a big revive, and if not, my heart gleamed with satisfaction whenever I chose correct to do a 1 man...or save for 3-5! However...the Mercy rework has come.The intentions were perfectly fine. Though, all in all...it wasn't done well. When she first got it, I admit fully that she was so broken. Instant revive...then Valkyrie with it resetting, then on 10 second cd? Insane it felt! Then, they nerfed her...and nerfed her...to the state she is now in.I have not played Overwatch in a few weeks, for my lovely hero who I felt a connection with had changed, and my bond with her was then tearing apart. The slow revive...it is not fun. It really isn't. It feels like a drag to revive someone, and usually you can only do it when the enemy team is nearly all dead. Her ultimate...I feel as though I need to get it quickly, as before! However...I don't look forward to it as I used to. I know that I can do plenty with it...but it just doesn't feel fun. It's hard to hit her flying around...her GA is so far...her beam range just isn't Mercy. Then soaring in the revive comrades who have fallen on the ground in combat, up to only 2, then flying back up. Sounds incredible...but doing it is lackluster. There is no adrenaline. There is no smile adorning my face. It feels like I am just a bot now...as though the names I was called before were true. Now...when I look at the big picture, people still think Mercy is the best support. She was fine for what..2 years? 3? with her 5 man revive (at max). Now being able to revive only one every 30 seconds...having to stand still for nearly 2 which makes one an easy target...that is op as well? My eyes turn to the side when I play her. I don't get enjoyment as I used to. I look towards other heroes because it's not fun to play Mercy. I have had a love for supporting people...healing, reviving them, boosting damage, and being able to fly...those are all incredible. And for those wonderful gifts to feel no longer pleasent to fight with is a true shame.She was the reason I bought Overwatch...I guess she's also the reason I am now drifting away.TLDR; New Mercy is no longer fun. She feels like broken scraps torn up."

I liked the pressure that old rez gave me. It helped me become a better player in a lot of aspects. Since I was such a high priority and I couldn't just shoot my way out.There are aspects about Mercy currently that I'd like on old Mercy like the ""angel bounce"" technique but besides that I don't really like Mercy anymore... Valkyrie isn't very much interesting simply due to the fact that you're MERCY. If you don't play Mercy as Intended...Valkyrie can be quite fun. You got Super mobility, infinite Ammo, and you have free reign over the skybox! Too bad you don't really get to use much of it...Old Rez was also super refreshing. Before it felt special because it was a break from your normal play as Mercy. You made a super huge play that could end up saving an entire team fight! The person who just sits back and heals! It was a 2nd wind my team and I could definitely use in most games. It was AMAZING the effect it had. Just hearing everyone in chat go NUTS over how important it was. Even if we lost the teamfight again...people would be like ""that was a great rez Mercy"" and I would too! Now it's kinda like...a chore. Something that's expected to happen every 30 seconds. It has impact but it never really FEELS impactful like the last one. &gt;.&gt; That's my take on this anyway. Yes! This explains it very well, haha. Though I find other parts of her...the intensity and meanfulness of being alive! Feeling proud of how fast you got revive! I wish I had to earn it...instead of being given it. It's like how DPS earn their kills. I want to earn my spot on the team, not just by healing, (which I earn by being aware, and swapping targets, predicting who will get damaged etc) but by using her special mechanic...reviving &lt;3"

https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760806795,Different approach to the Mercy rework,12/22/2017 23:30,"Hey everyone! So since Mercy's rework, i feel like she has become way too relevant, which has lead to some serious nerfs. I feel like after 300 hours of Mercy (both non-reworked and reworked) that Blizzard could have went with a different approach to Mercy instead of Valkyrie. So here's a list of changes i think is still not too late to do as some people isn't pleased with Valkyrie. I would love to hear people's opinions on this! Anyway, here we go; Change Valkyrie back to old Ressurrect  - Keep new mercy GA ""angel jump"" - Give res a resource meter   - When mercy gets her ult, the resource meter will be at 5 ( max charge; indicates how many resses)This will make it possible to res your whole team within the time frameWithin 5 seconds, the resource meter depletes to 0 instantly. From there you can increase the charge by healing / damage boosting / doing damage / selfhealing. Table for charge needed for various res charges: 1 man res: 100 charge 2 man res: 200 charges3 man res: 300 charges4 man res: 400 charges5 man res: 500 chargesNow, obviously these numbers can change to range from 10 to 1000, completely up to Blizzard.Now you might ask about the whole ""hide and res"" ordeal which is what made Blizzard rework Mercy in the first place. Here's the idea; after 6 - 7 seconds of doing nothing (or hiding) the resource meter starts depleting very quickly (I feel like after 9 seconds the resource meter should be completely empty. Just like Moira's Biotic Energy lasts 9 seconds at full charge). This will prevent the ""hide and seek"" methods which every Mercy player used. When the meter starts depleting, you can still use Res from where the rate is. For example;If you're at charge 4 and the meter starts depleting to 3, if you Res before the charge hits 3, you will res 4 teammates. Now, any number or mechanic here can be changed to suit Blizzards taste, this is just a start."

Since not very many of the cast shoot actual solids (Torb and Genji are examples) I'm torn between whether it can be deflected or absorbed like those or be an actual melee weapon and cannot. I'm not sure about a secondary fire, as I planned for the disk to be charged like Hanzo to shoot it faster and do more damage. The first ability would be like a scatter arrow but act more like an explosion and would do all it's damage at once instead of separate fragments bouncing around.  10 second reload maybe? The second ability would be either a piercing shot or a shocking disk that slows and denies ability use for a second or two. The ult would be activated like the Supercharger. They place down a device that prevents critical hits to their teammates until a certain amount of damage is absorbed and then becomes inactive. It blocks the extra damage taken after the critical multiplier and ideally would show it's affected targets the amount of damage left over to be absorbed. I'm not sure what the ideal lockon distance would be but it certainly respects LoS and breaks after 1 second when you can't see it.

https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760806801,[Video]Black screen server kick bug,12/23/2017 0:54,"This is not a disconnect, because if it was you would get kicked to the login screen, It happens to streamers some times so there may be a video out there showing it.The game acts like the server is blocking your games updates to the server while you can still use the ingame chat text, as well as being able to pm people.This video show what happens:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hr6uBy_39Z0Example of the bug:1.) You are playing normaly, then you can't move while everyone else is moving normaly, not when you are lagging and everything stops. 2.) The screen goes black with the loading icon spinning, this will either, after 20-30 seconds rejoin you to the game(see 3A), or you get some yellow text in the chat saying ""Failed to connect to server""(see 3B).3A.) When the server rejoins you it acts like a brand new game, displaying the teams. Then you have to pick a hero, it wont display the one you were playing, it will pick a random one like in the start of a new game.3B.) You have to press Esc, then select ""Leave Match"", then on the main menu select ""Rejoin Match"", sometimes you have to press it multiple times for anything to happen. When you join the match the game acts like it's a brand new game like 3A (see above).Possible ways to recreate/causes for this bug(mostly random):- (DVA) Activating new mech after ulting, just after being booped into a wall.- (Kill cam) As soon as the kill cam starts, you can't exit it, then the server kicks you.This has been going on for several months, and it seems to happen a lot more since the last update."

I rarely shoot barriers unless it's a Winston bubble because I can actually take those down.  Since this change that makes barrier accuracy not count, mine has dropped from 41 to 37 in just those few days that barrier damage reduced accuracy.Shooting barriers should either count or have no impact, but it should NOT count against you."

Highest ive seen anywhere anytime is mercy at 20% in gold.Without condoning or condemning the point of this thread-I feel there may be some confusion in regard to pick rate stats on your part. When you look at over buff and you see a pick rate stat, be it 4%, 8%, 16%, etc- That doesnt mean theyre showing up 4, 8, or 16% of the time- as in 4/8/16 times out of 100. It means theyre typically comprising 4/8/16/whatever of the hero SLOTS in a game. There are 12 slots in a game. 100/12=8.33. So any time you see someone at around 8%, that means theyre almost ALWAYS going to be in a game. But theres two teams. When you see heros such as mercy pushing 16%, this means its because BOTH sides are almost always picking her."

Wraithing into a teleport or teleporting into a wraith is really clunky and usually a suicide when escaping or entering combat.I think we all know the biggest issue is ShadowStep. It's only used well to escape spawn and a very wide flank (like gaps on Hanamura or Volskaya)It has its uses, but abilities that don't work in a fight are just bad.Shadowstep is counter-intuitive for Reaper. It's the only ability that doesn't give you an advantage when you're already fighting.Honestly I think Shadowstep and Wraith need reworks. While Reaper is in a niche state and is considered the ""highest F tier"" I don't want him buffed to Junkrat levels.So what could we do? Remove Shadowstep and give Wraith slight vertical movement, like a short Pharah hover or a Wallclimb. Not anything absurdThen what would Reaper's other ability be? Smoke BombsThey would probably be binded to Alt-Fire to feel more natural.Smoke bombs would work perfectly. He can throw them and wraith away for a better escape rather than risking a teleport.The only OP scenario I can picture is SmokeBombing a Graviton Surge.But other than that, it wouldn't be too absurd to fight. Even if Reaper wanted to death blossom into smoke, everyone already wants to escape the smoke so running from beyblade isn't too big of an issue.Here's what I'm proposing:ShadowBombsReaper stops shooting, and quickly shoots 4 smoke bombs from his guns.Like Junkrat bombs, but heavier so they have less range. Start smoking on impact with a: shield, barrier, wall, or floor-Fired 2 at a time, rapid burst so you can't make huge smoke walls-Around a 12 second cooldown, maybe higher-Each bomb has a small radius, around 2-4 meters-Last around 4 seconds, just enough for a quick getaway or an entryWhile I have extemely high doubts of this ever being ingame. I think it would work very well for Reaper and could even make him more interesting for normal gameplay and even esports.I hope the dev's consider a Reaper change soon"

This would make Sombra the one true counter to mobility heroes and I think it would be a great buff.Weapon spread is horrible, but 30% is a bit much with how many shots she has. Id say 15% spread reduction will do since she can still do good dmg. We don't really need her to be a Tank buster on poor Zarya.For stealth, you are completely wrong. It not just lets you run fast, but you can stall an objective for a bit with people not noticing and you can pick off supports easily. (Especially Zenyatta!) Her having a delay isnt a bad thing and her having no delay was a bit too strong since it allowed her to assassinate healers without a trail. Yes she should be stealthy, be hard to track and assassinate easily. But she shouldn't have no counterplay or way of to be predicted.For your last argument: when a hero has an ult and is hacked, everyone can see it clear as day. Plus, you should be calling it out either way since Sombra is meant to be an enabler character. She's a cross of support and flanker making her unique. But in the end, she is a form of support by her kit's design and requires coordination and calling out. You shouldn't have your team see it so easily that you don't have to tell them your plan. Sombra shouldn't be a solo carry hero and should never be buffed to be one. She carries the weight of your team, not the match. You give your team an easy game and open opportunities for them. If you think Sombra should be played for a solo carry environment, then you don't understand her design and play her wrong or ask for too much. Aside from that, you have a few good points and I do believe Sombra needs a few buffs. But the kind to make her a better enabler, not the kind to make her the new Tracer."

If you could come out of stealth even a slight bit faster I would shut my mouth and be happy. The thing is that in her current state her quality of life is pretty poor and that should be evident by pick rates across ALL levels of play (except pros as everyone loves to bring up) She got picked a lot on Anubis defense at one time but her pick rate has only dropped to Almost None again ever since."

But need to move from that single minded ideal of Sombra. We can do this by the following:1) Reduce spread so her DPS is more reliable2) Get a Hack reset every time she kills someone so she can Hack more often3) Stealth should become a resource meter to overall improve on consistency (not 100% on this)4) Every ability Sombra has SHOULD NOT have a delay5) Sugar Skulls on hacked enemies would make the world go round for Sombra6) Fix ALL SEVEN bugs that Sombra has so she can be at least functional"

https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760826845,So I started to log the reasons on why I win and lose...,"12/19/2017: (WON) Enemy team got 5 DPS mains and one 1 trick mercy main (enemies swapped around but to different DPS)12/19/2017: (LOST) Our Zarya took 4.5 minutes to get each ult, everyone stayed at choke and did not push when picks were made. Enemy team also had a smurf boosting a player12/19/2017: (LOST) Team wasn't putting any pressure on defend side of payload, basically letting the enemy get a HUGE free push on the payload. Coudn't do my job as Tracer because if I tried to backline or poke, it would become a 1v3 scenario due to the zero pressure . Also smurf zarya on my team refusing to combo with me and tell me her ultimate and throws her ultimate before she dies (wasting her ult each time). (yes i saved my ult for 2.3 minutes for the zarya since she refused to commuciate and she threw her ultimate outside the map)12/19/2017: (LOST) got 6 dps mains, one dps main can play ana only but said ""im not healing unless this switches"" (yes I am a dps only main as well. I know I am part of the problem)12/19/2017: (LOST) had a support main [mercy] who instalocked doomfist and they have 1 hour on him (in all game modes combined, 1 hour) left voice chat and started to throw. then next round someone took his doomfist and he swapped to hanzo (has only 2 hour on him in all game modes) user was also lvl 460 so it wasn't a smurf.-----*will start to write down my SR after each game after this point*-----12/19/2017: (WON) [Total SR: 3240]we struggled really hard to cap first point but we did it. We almost lost the first point on defense but we won. M","I wrote these down as truthful as possible. Majority of my games are full of smurfs and throwers. Majority of my loses are due to smurfs and throwers. Majority of my wins are due to smurfs and throwers. It is extremely rare to find a ""50/50"" game and what I mean by ""50/50"" is when both teams are equally skilled and where there is no smurfs or throwing involved. The amount of throwing in this game is INSANE. It is a lot to read but this is how ALL my games are. I recorded this for a few days just to show you how all my games are. I logged each game I played and did not skip any game at all.  I understand that me playing DPS only can not being a filler type of person can affect my rank but that isn't the main reason why I lose games. I always try my best every time I play rank even if I have throwers on my team, even if I have toxic people in my team I will always try my best in the game because I've won several games with throwers before. Losses: 27Wins: 24======atch felt extremely fair. It felt 50/50 no one wa trolling or throwing. (i did extremely bad in the beginning i felt like my detahs were bogus, I dashed in traps 3 times, i peaked stairs for 0.1 second and a reinhardt was charging at me. I picked up my slack from 0 kills and 5 deaths to 31 kills and 10 deaths (gold kills) i played genji / tracer.atch felt 50 / 50 one user from the enemy team started to throw, he swapped to Doomfist and kept 1v6ing and feeding and dying on purpose.y team and the enemy team had 1 smurf in it and the enemy team were throwing and we are like cool, easy game. But we couldn't even push the first point and one user started to get toxic with the team calling us bad etc.... then he started to throw and we pretty much loss against throwers. Pretty sad.ercy who was being boosted by a master and a smurf diamond so maybe thats why?ei (which he doesnt play) and started to throw the game. We got steam rolled and lost. Did the game feel 50/50? If our team would listen to call outs and the ""leader"" and not have a thrower in our team then probably we would of won. How did I play? Well I was tracer and I got their healer EVERY fight we were going into, I even commuicated that I got mercy etc... but no follow ups especially when the leader says push to point and I am alone on it with the team still at the choke .-.ccree and a junkrat in our team.

Maybe at lower ranks where players depended more on ults to win fights, since old rez could counter every ultimate the enemy could throw at you only if it was used at the last moment.

I think the biggest reason she became a nuisance to some is because she could acquire her ult unreasonably fast for how powerful it was (and it was powerful to compensate for her kit.) It also doesn't help that the other healers have had their healing nerfed in one way or another, making Mercy's healing seem disproportionate in comparison (although I'd argue that a dedicated healer should do more healing).I just want the community to stop perpetuating the lie that Mercy has always been overpowered, viable, and a must pick.

Every other Blizzard game has hubs; this is literally the only title that doesn't. So what this will do is allow players to find 6 stack groups easily without having to worry about insane queue times. So instead of hoping you dont get stacked with 5 dps mains (it happens), you can have a voluntary option to find a team that suits your needs instead of forcing you to be obligated to suffer through that.who this fixes - one tricks can find a team that supports them- teams arent forced to play with one tricks they dont feel are useful- teams arent forced to be put in roles they arent comfortable with (necessarily)All the while, keep the queue system the same, so if you just want to hop in, there it is.

As for everyone else, how would you feel about this? Being able to see your friendly Symmetra's shield generator or teleporter through walls. Would you help defend it occasionally and or check on it?

Not everyone likes playing every tank, dps, healer, etc. So if someone were to play with a Healer selection but they only play mercy but mercy is taken what are they going to do if they don't know how to play any other healer, If defined as a role select system it could be that they don't have to ability to play any other role so their basically useless for their team if they cant convince the other player to trade.Also this would lead to longer queue times and worse team compositions, Because what happens when one of your players leave, Its either going to have to fill that role which means your not going to have a player for a longer time than usual or its going to give you a DPS to fill your healer role.Defining this role selection whatsoever could help a lot though, because your just calling it by a name with little meaning. It would either Enforce 2-2-2 or be more like a preferred role system where you could select a role you would like to play and possibly one that your okay with player, and maybe even one you definitely cannot play or will not play. There's also the issue still of how your going to match these players together because its either 2-2-2 for the preferred roles or player defined as to what else they would like on their team, With 2-2-2 it would most likely end up with longer queue times, Which would be pointless to add to ""Quick Play"" if your just going to increase Queue times. The best thing you could do for a system like this is go to a 3rd party website or something like that, that will help you join a team of players willing to fill those roles along with you then you can 6 stack matches with these roles, all done by the community.Other than that they don't intend to shift the meta, ideally it would be best for every hero to have a counter, to counter someone, and be equal to most other heroes, but at the current state of the game and basically every past state you shouldn't be trying to win alone, you should be communicating with your team and to out play the enemies and win, but this is all optional."

As to the implication that the streched aspect ratio makes it easier to hit targets I find that isn't really true it does enlargen everything horizontally, this however is only more visual as lowering your fov will also make the targets ""larger"". Also it's not a matter if how many people use 4:3 as I use this on a 16:9 Monitor ( I just prefer this streched aspect ratio ). Also the same principle in this change applies to 21:9 Monitors."

Blizzard having to delegate some resources to this instead of new content. Even then, this should've been supported from the beginning.
