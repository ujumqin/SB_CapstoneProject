The Mercy players obviously don't like this nerf and if you make ressurect too easy to cast and Mercy is in every match again you will have alienated everyone who isn't a Mercy player.It's okay to backtrack sometimes and a complete revert isn't needed but Ressurect has no place in this game as a regular ability."

This was originally done to fix bugs on a couple heroes, but the changes are systemic and affect all Heroes.   Specifically, movement on the ground is much more consistent. Going up/down inclines will no longer affect the Hero’s speed.  Previously, inclines could either make you move slightly faster or slightly slower, depending on the circumstances. Inclines will also no longer cause a small amount of strafing movement when moving diagonally on them.   A side effect of these changes is characters will now have slightly better air control.   For example, Winston previously was not able to easily make small adjustments to his flight path during his Jump Pack leap, but now he should be able to do that, and it is also noticeable on many of the other Heroes that are often in the air.We think these changes will overall be great improvements but there might be some unintended side effects that we’d love your help finding on the PTR!Thanks!"

Rez was suicide 90% of the time before invulnerability was added in February. It was finally ""acceptable"" to play Mercy, because her ult was no longer a death sentence. She wasn't considered viable up until that point, and after becoming viable, no one complained about her. No one complained about ""hide and rez"", either.Even with her invuln, Ana and Lucio (or was it Zenyatta?) were still favored over Mercy. Pre-rework Mercy wasn't overpowered and the myth that most Mercy players hid and rezzed was a nonproblem at best. I think the biggest reason she became a nuisance to some is because she could acquire her ult unreasonably fast for how powerful it was (and it was powerful to compensate for her kit.) It also doesn't help that the other healers have had their healing nerfed in one way or another, making Mercy's healing seem disproportionate in comparison (although I'd argue that a dedicated healer should do more healing).I just want the community to stop perpetuating the lie that Mercy has always been overpowered, viable, and a must pick. She was, at one point, for a very long time, considered underpowered and in dire need of a buff (or several)."

It wasn't until her invulnerability buff in S4 that brought her inline with the other supports, and then people were complaining about how they didn't get a free kill on her which sparked the rework which has brought us in the situation we are currently in."

I don't buy it, they could easily create free content with the money they have made from sales alone. Apparently they have 35 million active accounts. 35 million x $40 = 1.4 billion. Lootboxes are a feature to keep the cash cow milking people of money by giving them a chance to get an item then coercing people who don't get the item to roll the dice again. It's insidious but people believe the narrative that without them the game would fail and content would not be free when evidently they've made more than enough for that not to be the case.You don't have to buy lootboxes? It's a cosmetic thing. Like... I don't have to buy an Overwatch shirt if I don't want... sure it would be nice, but I can decide if I want to put my money into it or if the cosmetic value of that shirt just isn't worth it. You can still get lootboxes for free by playing, and buy skins using currency if you don't get the ones you want but you've been grinding. It's not like they give you an ingame advantage. Some people have lots of money and they can afford to throw a little away, and those are the kind of people it targets. If you can't afford it, don't buy them?It's a valid point they are not essential for gameplay however if this is the case and have no impact why not let people directly purchase the skins they want then? Why hide them behind this RNG system. Time is more valuable than money. Why spend an hour or two of my life to grind for a skin when I could buy it. But not outright you have to purchase the chance. That is the fundamental problem I have with the lootbox system. People with addiction problems may not have the willpower to resist the temptation. Restrictions need to be in place I just don't see the necessity for the RNG system. Well I know why it's there I disagree with the practice and nature of it."

She's easy to hit and can be, frozen, halt'd, concussive blasted, hooked, hacked, punched, boostered, booped, sleep darted and charged away from the target, cancelling the ability. It's a lot to deal with as the Mercy, not to mention avoiding flankers. Somehow it all comes down to the cool down and the lack of things to do if it were longer.

People claiming that it will always make Mercy a must-have clearly missed the tank aka Ana meta.What killed Ana was Winston’s buff and the dive meta that followed.So I agree that resurrect could be balanced - it was.  The offensive options being op is why the meta began favoring high mobility and the ability to resurrect instagibbed allies.Having said that, old resurrect was a complaint for many, but really it was because it felt bad when it countered your efforts.  When a big resurrect had that impact, it generally meant the offense screwed up and blew all their ultimates.  Rather than accept that, they cried until it was removed.And hide and seek Mercy was usually a losing strategy.  Most good Mercy players didn’t hide, they avoided being caught in ultimates, while supporting their team 99% of the time.Ironically, I now find myself hiding far more than ever to avoid rip tires every 30 seconds, as there’s no other way to avoid it reliably."

You clearly don't understand Mercy's character at all. You do realize she was happy/relieved when Overwatch disbanded, right? She doesn't approve of violence AT ALL, and only joined Overwatch because it gave her the opportunity to save lives on a much larger scale.Resurrect as an ult is directly in line with her lore as a violence-hating doctor obsessed with saving lives. And yes, she was vastly more balanced with resurrect as an ult and only needed tweaks to make it feel fair to fight against (such as possibly removing invulnerability during res, slowing her ult percentage gain rate by two or three times, and maybe requiring los.)"

Or nerf Valkyrie. She has the most consistent healing in the game, and really good mobility.  She fits a roll no other healer can fulfill.- Ana gets bufu'd by flankers cause of her lack of mobility, and by barriers for healing. Requires a really high skill to land and duel any sort of flank coming at you. Zenny follows this philosophy too.- Lucio is okay. Ultimate change hurt him a lot. Wall ride change hurt him a lot. I stopped playing Lucio outside of closed beta so I don't really want to comment on what I feel he needs. - Zenyatta is interesting. He is rather easy to kill, but you still got to respect him. He can heal through barriers, but his healing is super low. Maybe since he single target heals, and the orb requires line of sight to stay on longer it should get a buff? Not sure.- Moira is absolutely fun. Great mobility, interesting gameplay. She suffers from the lack of consistent healing, and the nerf to her orb hitting barriers really stopped her from opening up chokes. I don't think she needs any changes outside of the healing orb not being able to get eaten by DVA/Reflected by genji. While she does get high healing numbers, it is sort of like what Lucio used to do before he got nerfed in that her healing is usually spread out and in really large bursts. She isn't as consistent as Mercy, and has no aerial access like Mercy as well.Mercy is the hardest to kill of the healers cause of her mobility is only limited by your team. A Moira playing selfishly is pretty good at surviving too, but she has limited healing resource where as Mercy does not. So until there is another high mobility, single target healer that doesn't get punished by barriers, and doesn't run out of resource Mercy will always be a good pick."

And %100 pickrate means more than viable = so hood mandatory.What is viable anyway mean to u. Unkillable and overly strong. Still no arguments address the fact she has a near perfect pickrate and is always the choice.I am just arguing that we should not only judge a hero's power-level based on pick-rate alone, but also take the role into account. Otherwise there is going to be constant nerfs to Mercy until we come to a tipping point where it makes no sense playing Mercy at all. Mercy fulfils a unique role as the only dedicated healer that focuses solely on keeping team-members alive, and as such she'll have the highest pick-rate even if she ends up being completely balanced... If they keep nerfing her at that point just because she still has high pick-rate she'll end up being underpowered.Well ya that's the point she needs to hit a tipping point then possibly get a small buff after. Why should she not be on that line(tipping point) while ever other hero is much closser to it.Arguing you shouldn't balance her at all bc eventually she will be underwhelming is just dumb.It's like saying ya big businesses we're out of control in the industrial revolution but let's not put any labor laws in place or businesses might all leave."

She's easy to heal with.Mercy: It's click and hold to heal/damage boost. Pistol can be whipped out for self defense.Other supports:Ana: Aim to heal/damage while keeping a balance between heals and damage.Lucio: Stay within range and heal while outputting damage.Zen: Toss healing/discord orbs strategically while keeping a balance between heals and damage. Moira: Requires slight aim to heal. Must figure out whether to use a healing/damage orb mid battle, and how to do consistent damage to maintain steady heals. I mean sure Mercy players have to be alert and have decent game sense but when you break it down to the basics she is just an all around easy hero to play and if you say otherwise I just might have to call you stupid. She easily has the best healing in the game with one of the easiest ways of outputting it.Good luck fixing that broken mechanic Blizzard."

Even when he was S tier Ana was the most important healer to have, and Zen could easily take Lucio's place as off healer. Even Mercy could take Lucio's place in Pharmercy comps.Maybe its because Lucio brings 90% utility to the table, since his speed boost is what got him there, but current Mercy brings 100% healing and 50% extra utility with Rezzes and chain heals/boosts.

Maybe at lower ranks where players depended more on ults to win fights, since old rez could counter every ultimate the enemy could throw at you only if it was used at the last moment. Mass Rez was crazy, and Mercy eventually started to powercreep her way to high ranks thanks to the invulnerability buff letting Rez be used as an escape mechanism and as a method to force the pace of the match with tempo rezzes, but Ana, Lucio and Zen were also crazy."

Once you get that, everything else falls into place. Game awareness will keep you updated on who needs healing and where, and GA mechanics help in staying alive when in combination to game awareness. Moira needs to balance between attacking and healing to be effective. I have out-healed too many Moiras as Zenyatta without using his trans, and that shouldn't happen imo when she has almost 3x the amount of healing he does, without the use of her orb. However, she does still need to do damage because she needs it to charge her healing resource meter. So, that balance is necessary, and hard to maintain if you're not used to it."

And I was on track to get higher until my good laptop broke.People say ""communication is everything"" but in my experience you don't need to talk to coordinate. You can tell when they're going in, when big ults are about to happen, etc etc. As long as you are playing your hero well, everything should fall into place generally speaking. Will you win every match? No. But you don't with voice chat either, the difference here is you don't have 5 people blaming you when you lose.I agree with you so much. I give everyone the beginning chance of being respectful and not complete douches. Sadly, they fail at it often in chat.  The report function is your friend...   but then they interfere with trying to concentrate and have fun- they change the experience on my end... so I silence them... SO much better.  In reality, they are complete strangers who do no mean a thing. I do not NEED to listen to their toxicity - there is always a choice. Redhood- below: I am glad you had good experiences... sadly its not the case for many of us.  I will say this... I played with a team where most of the males were probably 12 or 13 today and maybe one male was their Dad (guessing but could be wrong)... They were more respectful than 90% of the males I have witnessed ingame. That is pretty sad.  Adult males or even post pubescent males should know better. Do they want their Moms or sister treated this way? Then why do it to others. Manners and some kind of vales system would be nice."

The Shimada dragons and Zenyatta's robo-Buddha orbs imply that magic does exist in the Overwatch universe, so it's not so far-fetched that Ana has some sort of magic darts and fluid that are actually just hexed or something. I mean otherwise she'd just be a stupid character that got wedged in as a cool idea with little regard for the non-biotic and armored cast.Of course this would open up more possibilities.

It's used more to prevent enemies to get on the objective.When you get killed, stunned, hooked or sleep-darted, now the ultimate doesn't refundMinor problems:Icicles:They are the only projectiles affected by damage decayThe minimum damage they can do is 22 (because of the damage decay), and compared to other heroes, this is not really muchIce wall:Allies can't see where are you going to place the wall, and this can make them frustrated easily, and this favors the trolling(These are some ways proposed by me and other players to make her more viable)Buff suggestions:Frost stream:Now it decreases the effect of ""special movement"" abilities (like double jumps, run, and similar abilities), initial debuff effect from 10% that increases up to 25%Now affects vertical movements tooFrozen shields will take (20%) more damageSpeed has been increased to 30 m/sThis adjustment will make her primary mechanic more effective, punishes players that tries to engage Mei closely and makes her able to give teammates an occasion to destroy a shield.Cryofreeze:Now automatically reloads her weapon similar to Wraith FormAna and Moira's orbs now can heal Mei in cryofreezeNow Mei will be ready to fight again, and will be able to be healed by other healers. Blizzard:When you are killed, stunned, sleep-darted or hooked, Snowball (the drone) continues to go as a grenade and get activatedIt decreases enemies's movement abilities effect as the primary fire, but up to 45% this timeThe cast time should be reduced/removed. Mei can lose the ultimate when the drone is in her hand and not while it's out of her hand and it's going to landNow the ultimate can be used as an area denial and crowd control tool. It will punish poor enemy positioning more often, and will reward players that can escapeIciclesThe damage falloff should be reduced (minimum range or damage increased)Ice wallNow allied can see the aura of where the wall will be spawned (proposed by XodiaK)It's slippery for enemies: if a Genji tries to climb it, a Widowmaker tries to grapple or a Lucio tries to wallride on it, they will fall. This will make rage less the teammates because they will know where the wall will be (useful also for players without a microphone). Probably this will discourage the trolling. Also will make it a better defense tool.Netcode/latenciesWhen Mei enters in cryofreeze it actives without the possibility to be hooked/stunned/killed and she starts to heal herselfWhen the wall spawns bullets can't trepass itThis will make Mei more viable and less frustrating to play, with these issues fixed and with a better netcodeBug and issues:Check the Reddit threads i linked, there are listed all Mei bugs with proofsTL;DRMei at the moment she's inefficient compared to other heroesShe needs bug fixes,QoL fixes/adjustments and few buffsA lot of heroes can escape her freeze ray and her ultimate.She got a lot of unfixed bugs(Sorry for the wall of text.)"

However, freezing through and obstacles that is within the ult area could be implemented, but I guess it is not easy workingsYeah I'm guessing so, it seems hard to balance this, but it should freeze through obstacles within the area of effect.

QoL Changes(potentially also buffs)Stuff like remove jumping wear, able to destroy wall after dead, etc3. Balance ChangesNumerical tweaking, like increase damage, reduce range and stuff. Sometimes could change the hero's playstyle4. Ability ReworksStuff like D.Va's DM becomes resource-based, and Torb's new scrap mechanics5. New abilityReplacing an existing one with a new one, probably because the old one is not good6. RebalancingSimilar to Lucio 2.0 and the current Bastion, which changes the attributes of the old kit. Results are kind of unknown though7. Total ReworkThere is that ONE hero who has gone through this process, the results are still controversial till this dayPersonally I don't have an answer on which type of changes I want, but improving her such that she is better as and against is probably the final goal for everyone here."

Fixing her known bugs, which cripple her playstyle.2) Frost stream: make her left-click hitscan, and delete the total freeze effect. Replace it with a bigger slow effect (that lingers for a bit) and disables movement abilities after 0.8 sec (to give them time to get out if they react fast enough). This gives her a true role of anti-flanker. A bit of extra damage would be appreciated as well.3) increase the minimum damage on her right click (max range) to 35/40.4) Ice wall: add an extra pillar for more versatility. Add an indicator for the allied teamembers as well.5) cryo-freeze: cut the time in the ice-block to 3 sec, and increase her healing accordingly. Make her reload her gun over time in cryo-freeze.6) Blizzard: make the thrown ultimate act like a grenade and activate regardless of mei's life. Make the ult freeze a tad faster as well. It's too escapable right now."

I'm sure the devs read the forums, certainly not daily, but the only evidence that they read our comments is little tidbits like this that come months after the problem has been caught by the playerbase, and that isn't okay. Look at all of the Mercy mega-threads. 7000 comments over 3 different threads, and not one response to any of the comments or suggestions. There have been at least 2 Doomfist Mega threads of about a thousand each, and only after someone called out Jeff on not paying attention to Doomfist, and two incredibly detailed bug posts after almost 6 months of being useless does he start getting addressed.Theres a Symmetra thread with 2000 comments on the front page, and any acknowledgement to that would be wonderful.I'm glad Mei is finally getting recognized.

Hanzo is best at mid range, peeking corners, and spamming arrows. Body shots do 125 full charge, and his wall climb and sonic arrows provide useful situational benefits. Being a projectile, the arrows are actually somewhat easy to predict and avoid in comparison to widowmakers hitscan. 250 damage headshots vs 300 damage. Widowmaker is best at medium- long range. A hanzo close trumps you due to scattershot and quicker arrow charge. Widowmaker's hook is far better than wall climb, but its on a cooldown so it averages out imo. Try running from a winston or dva as hanzo... Try getting around reinhardt shield as hanzo... get to the top of the map as hanzo...  Killing pharah is FAR easier with widowmaker, as well as mercy and other high mobility characters minus scatter shot. Widowmaker and hanzo both have their situations that one is better than the other, but skill makes up the difference. A god tier widow will be useful where a ""decent"" hanzo is not, and vice versa. A widowmaker can down a roadhog in two shots; where hanzo needs three consecutive headshots to seal the deal. Is one better than the other? No. While both snipers, they both are different roles, and both perform incredibly different from each other."

Lies.You're also biasing the PoTG system even further towards DPS with your multikill angle. It's an even dumber system than what we already have in place. I swear to god I saw many times Mercy randomly healing 2 people on the objective after a tean fight though they didn't lose so much of their hp. Also, I saw a Hanzo potg with no single hit or any damage done, but when it comes up to me sending a DVa bomb into the enemy team and killing four people, the potg is just a bastard torb killing 2 already weakended guys on my team.

Please Watchhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kDqZ_dsZAQ________Recently purchased a amazing new Ultrawide monitor however I've since learned that Overwatch does not support true 21:9 aspect ratio and instead crops the game to fit which actually ends up showing less than normal 16:9. Apparently Blizzard says it would be unfair and thus has implemented this janky version instead. Why are you crippling Ultrawide users by showing them less than 16:9 I'm baffled. I'm here to beg Blizzard to please reconsider. The real argument at hand here is if Blizzard is concerned about competitive play then why is no one discussing the other things that also give advantages like console users being able to play with mouse and keyboard or people with better internet giving them lower latency or monitor refresh rates giving better accuracy and smoothness. Why is that the people who have decided to upgrade their hardware to Ultrawides must chose whether or not to play with black bars or this severely cropped version. I find it rather baffling that every major title that has been release in the last 10 years has support for true 21:9 resolutions including other competitive shooters and mobas like CS:GO or HOTS yet somehow it's not okay in Overwatch. What makes Overwatch different from other competitive shooters that 21:9 is not okay here but okay everywhere else? What about Destiny 2 that just came out, I've been playing it and it looks amazing because it supports the real aspect ratio and is not cropped; even the pre-rendered cutscenes are in true 21:9 which I commend Bungie for because even games like Witcher3 give black boarders during cutscenes. The reality is that casuals players like myself simply just want to play the game and have fun and basically telling us that our hardware is unfair is silly. We aren't going to competitive offline tournaments where 16:9 is the standard so what is the big deal here? No one wants to play with black bars on their screen when every other game in the world including all other competitive shooters support real 21:9. Forget CS:GO, what about Gears, CoD, BattleField, Destiny2 all competitive shooters supporting 21:9. Overwatch is a freaking casual game, just let people enjoy themselves. Like others have pointed out in this thread how often would any of you people against 21:9 even run into players like me with Ultrawides when only 1% users even own one.Can we please get an update on this or will Blizz stay forever silent on this issue?"

These days it's determined vertically, but these days widescreen is the norm anyways."

Everything just becomes incredibly smoother, faster, and more responsive thus allowing for better reactions in-game especially on higher skill capped characters like Genji or Widowmaker; you will definitely gain an advantage over those who don't have access to these. I just don't understand why Blizzard wants to hold back users from getting the full benefit out of their hardware. Controlling refresh rates is beyond their control but cropping monitor resolutions so you actually see less than than of 16:9 is beyond silly."

If this happens, users with normal 16:9 monitors will be able to have to option to see just as much as ultrawide users, and ultrawide users will be able to have proper ultrawide support but not as high fov so they can not have an advantage. If both had the same fov, this problem would still exist, but if you let 16:9 users have even higher fov and let normal ultrawide users keep current fov and have the game how they did during beta, I think this could all work out."
