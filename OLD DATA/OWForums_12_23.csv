(my personal big issue with this)*Possible solution to this-pause respawn timer/prevent it from going out while Mercy is resurrecting target player-reset Mercy's resurrect if target player respawns before resurrect takes effect2) The non-reset to GA when ulting is dandy.

The Mercy players obviously don't like this nerf and if you make ressurect too easy to cast and Mercy is in every match again you will have alienated everyone who isn't a Mercy player.It's okay to backtrack sometimes and a complete revert isn't needed but Ressurect has no place in this game as a regular ability."

But that won't stop me from giving it.The cast time is a welcome addition that helps give diversity to Mercys kit, making resurrect feel powerful in ultimate. The slowdown is counter intuitive to her mobility and her new core identity as a highly mobile hero with heavy constant healing.I say either lock Mercy to the ressurected target while she is casting so that she can still feel somewhat mobile and have a chance to dodge aroundOr remove resurrect as an E, up the charges in valkryie, and give us an upward mobility ability on E that could be replaced when she uses Valkryie.No character who's core identity is ""high mobility"" should be subjected to such a harsh slowdown.

This was originally done to fix bugs on a couple heroes, but the changes are systemic and affect all Heroes.   Specifically, movement on the ground is much more consistent. Going up/down inclines will no longer affect the Hero’s speed.  Previously, inclines could either make you move slightly faster or slightly slower, depending on the circumstances. Inclines will also no longer cause a small amount of strafing movement when moving diagonally on them.   A side effect of these changes is characters will now have slightly better air control.   For example, Winston previously was not able to easily make small adjustments to his flight path during his Jump Pack leap, but now he should be able to do that, and it is also noticeable on many of the other Heroes that are often in the air.We think these changes will overall be great improvements but there might be some unintended side effects that we’d love your help finding on the PTR!Thanks!"

Every patch that comes out puts the other supports in better places, and just dumps on Lucio more and more."

This was originally done to fix bugs on a couple heroes, but the changes are systemic and affect all Heroes.   Specifically, movement on the ground is much more consistent. Going up/down inclines will no longer affect the Hero’s speed.  Previously, inclines could either make you move slightly faster or slightly slower, depending on the circumstances. Inclines will also no longer cause a small amount of strafing movement when moving diagonally on them.   A side effect of these changes is characters will now have slightly better air control.   For example, Winston previously was not able to easily make small adjustments to his flight path during his Jump Pack leap, but now he should be able to do that, and it is also noticeable on many of the other Heroes that are often in the air.We think these changes will overall be great improvements but there might be some unintended side effects that we’d love your help finding on the PTR!Thanks!I made a post in the forums about living in Puerto Rico and not being able to play Overwatch. I’d appreciate it if you checked it out. Thanks :)"

Their healing output would be increased which is a plus and it still an assist.I am still for Ana getting a damage buff increased to 75 instead of 70. 75 is perfect for her to be honest. I think the Grenade needs to be reduced in cooldown slightly. It's 10 seconds but I always wanted it to be 8 seconds.These are just my thoughts.Ana needs Buffs, but all of those combined would make her seriously OP. I suggest 2-3 or them. Everyone thinks that Ana is in a bad spot right now, but the reality is that Mercy is super OP and simply Outclasses Ana. I feel like we should wait until Mercy is balanced until we start claiming that Ana is in desperate need of so many buffs."

She needs something that will increase her survivability, like shorter sleep CD and the casting time from it removed.And more healing is a bad thing because?Because she is already extremely good at it, she just doesn't do sustain healing, she does burst healing. So while she doesn't get the numbers Mercy does she can actually save lives in the middle of an intense fire fight. This change would give her good sustain and burst which is OP and would also bring back the tank meta. The only way something like this would make sense is if they removed the bonus healing from nade or made it only 25%. Ana does not need more healing."

No. They're too prideful to do such a thing and will not change her because they think she's completely fine. She isn't fun, she's overpowered, and this game is suffering because of it. While they run about occasionally doing something about the game, they're focusing mainly on OWL.Why? Because money.First off your,premise is wrong on every level.  Ana is more fun for OWL views than Mercy so if that were the goal they would buff Ana.Second if the ONLY change you made to Mercy was a nerf that made it so rez only worked during valk she would still be the,best healer in the game by far.

It's just an excuse to why they got killed, I for example wouldn't perform well on Pharah, I've played her a bit but if I would go in diamond and play her I'd drop dead because I am simply not good enough on her.Some heroes requires a different type of ""skill"" then just to aim at the head and click."

A good Pharah can destroy the enemy team and a good hog will make life very hard for DPS and healers.  Hog is the most survivable hero in the game because of his heal and damage reduction, so people may think he's a low skill pick.  But it's very easy to feel invincible when playing him and walk into the enemy team to die.  He also feeds the enemy ults very quickly.

And I have seen some people playing Mercy who really shouldn't be playing Mercy. Honestly I think the question of ""skill"" is pointless. If someone is in the same match as you, they have similar stats and the game believes you are similar in ability. They won't always perform at what the game expects but if you look at people's performance over time the game is usually pretty accurate.

Even Mercy requires skills like team work, positioning and planningBecause EVERY hero requires team work, positioning, and planning. Thus when comparing two heroes together they cancel out.Ofc every hero requires that - we're not denying that, but when someone is raging at a ""no skill"" hero when they're being outplayed it's often because they're either lacking, or not relying on those particular skills as much as they should be. Anyway from my perspective, and as someone with a lot of hours on ""low skill"" heroes you just shouldn't listen to people complaining about ""low skill"" - they're mostly just angry you're beating them.As someone who also regularly swaps heroes to try and balance a match I definitely have to rethink my game, my positioning, and my teamwork depending on the hero I'm using. As Widowmaker I rarely have to care that much about positioning - so long as I'm way back from the action and repositioning regularly I'm pretty safe, and effective at my job. As Symmetra I might not have to aim, but I do have to be constantly aware of where we are on the map, listening for audio cues, predicting which route an enemy will take, and deciding which ult is most effective and if I should disengage to go and place it, or if I need to stay in that team right. I also need to stay aware of our supports and try and protect them from flankers, or decide if it's worth me risking flanking myself. I'm absolutely not saying Widow is low skill - but I personally find her to have a more relaxing play style than Symmetra because I mostly need to focus on aiming and self preservation.I've lost count of the times I've been told by someone playing a 'high skill' hero (badly) that i should kill myself for actively countering or outplaying them. If you're a Widowmaker/Genji dying repeatedly to a Symmetra then there is something SERIOUSLY wrong with your positioning/teamwork/game sense. It makes no sense to stick to your 'high skill' heroes when it isn't working. It's pig-headed, stupid, and ultimately costs your team a win.For reference my two most played heroes are Mercy and Symmetra - and we all know what the forums thinks of those two - my next most played heroes are Ana and Widowmaker - I do just as well with them in the right situation - but I will switch off my 'high skill' hero for a better suited pick. The fact that I have more hours on Mercy that I do on Ana is because just about every game I have a suicidal Genji off on one side of the map, a Widow stood way back from the action, and a bunch of other DPS that won't group up with the one tank that we (might) have. I don't stand a cat in hells chance of healing with Ana/Moira (who both have high healing output) in that situation by design, but I can zip between heroes with Mercy. As Ana I have to try and laser focus on all these DPS all over the place and risk being ganked myself because no one is with me - and as Moira I have limited control over healing - those balls are great, but unless my team is grouped up I can't heal consistently with her"

Then they broke him to pieces, then tried to fix him a bit.I think in his current state he's easier to stay alive on than most heroes, but that doesn't mean I think he's ""LolNoSkill.""  The hook combos can be hard to land and execute, and anyone who says it's EZ mode has never really played a lot of current Roadhog.Also, the staying alive part can be a bad thing, as a sub-par Roadhog player is going to end up simply feeding the enemy team ulti charge.

Ana can easily sleep dart you sine you are huge, and grenade neutralized a lot of your potential tankiness.

Does anyone else think that they are low or no skill heroes?They aren't cheap, Roadhog especially. I say him because he's so easily countered by a Tracer/Genji of the same skill as the Hog.Pharah is sort of..eh; to me, at least. She does require some skill, but she is still absolutely infuriating to go against. That's likely why people say she's ""cheap""."

Roadhog can literally be one of the most valuable heroes in the game; his hook can immediately eliminate a key target from the fight. Yes, the hook has a huge hitbox, and it is incredibly easy to hit tanks and pull them in. At that point however, all your really doing is feeding support ultimates and Zarya charge. Those hooks onto a Valkyrie mode Mercy or an ulting Genji are what makes Hog both valuable and skillful. Pharah is an example of a hero that can be incredibly punishing if one is skilled with her. It takes minimal skill to fly around on Nepal with a Mercy babysitting you and get a few kills. The skill comes with her accuracy and movement. The key to playing Pharah is making the time that you spend visable to hitscans within their comfortable medium range a minimum, and dispatch of them with two rockets. Even further, playing Pharah without a Mercy and dominating takes great positioning and accuracy.TL;DR: They have a relatively high skill ceiling, and when played well can be extremely rewarding for the team."

Yeah, call me whatever you want.Skill-less. Brain dead. M1M1M1M1M1. Rez bot. Pathetic. Boosted. Yes. I can't say these words don't hurt, because they do. However, playing Mercy gives me passion. Some may not understand it; I don't exactly expect you to! Everyone is different and connects with varying heroes. ^^ So, let me just talk about Mercy before her re-work.Sure. Hiding wasn't as fun...and fighting a Mercy who just hid, flew in, revived everyone wasn't fun either. What was though, was the intensity to gather enough charge for revive, constantly feeling on edge, healing everyone, damage boosting every ability to get your ult quickly. It made healing more enjoyable. Sometimes, we got POTG too, not always, but sometimes. It was nice...for at least one shining moment a support's love and work for the team was shown.I used to hear in the voice comms wonderful comments whenever I pulled of a big revive, and if not, my heart gleamed with satisfaction whenever I chose correct to do a 1 man...or save for 3-5! However...the Mercy rework has come.The intentions were perfectly fine. Though, all in all...it wasn't done well. When she first got it, I admit fully that she was so broken. Instant revive...then Valkyrie with it resetting, then on 10 second cd? Insane it felt! Then, they nerfed her...and nerfed her...to the state she is now in.I have not played Overwatch in a few weeks, for my lovely hero who I felt a connection with had changed, and my bond with her was then tearing apart. The slow revive...it is not fun. It really isn't. It feels like a drag to revive someone, and usually you can only do it when the enemy team is nearly all dead. Her ultimate...I feel as though I need to get it quickly, as before! However...I don't look forward to it as I used to. I know that I can do plenty with it...but it just doesn't feel fun. It's hard to hit her flying around...her GA is so far...her beam range just isn't Mercy. Then soaring in the revive comrades who have fallen on the ground in combat, up to only 2, then flying back up. Sounds incredible...but doing it is lackluster. There is no adrenaline. There is no smile adorning my face. It feels like I am just a bot now...as though the names I was called before were true. Now...when I look at the big picture, people still think Mercy is the best support. She was fine for what..2 years? 3? with her 5 man revive (at max). Now being able to revive only one every 30 seconds...having to stand still for nearly 2 which makes one an easy target...that is op as well? My eyes turn to the side when I play her. I don't get enjoyment as I used to. I look towards other heroes because it's not fun to play Mercy. I have had a love for supporting people...healing, reviving them, boosting damage, and being able to fly...those are all incredible. And for those wonderful gifts to feel no longer pleasent to fight with is a true shame.She was the reason I bought Overwatch...I guess she's also the reason I am now drifting away.TLDR; New Mercy is no longer fun. She feels like broken scraps torn up."

It's so difficult to raise for Mercy and you have to do or gamble so much for it be active when you actively know you're putting in a ton of work. You have to rez consistently, damage boost assists over healing assists, and tag/kill enemies with your pistol.So how does that feel when the meter is said to indicate the impact you've had on the game and you might see it over 1/4 tops? Probably discouraging. It's always kind of been this way too, except for when? When Mercy would hide, pop off a huge Rez, and now she was on fire. Psychologically... it feels good. Honestly, if anyone says ""Mercy requires no skill"" just play a game and try to keep that meter even 1/4 filled through the entire game and your role as a healer. That alone takes miles of skill."

This is a very valid opinion! :D Let's agree to disagree! My input though is that Valkyrie feels less impactful-though it may hold the same impact. I feel less decisions. When one person falls it's like we're expected to instantly revive them, and the only choice is really over dps...support...or tank? Where before, it was, tempo, we need them now to help point, or save for larger since I predict an oncoming team-wipe. Then the intensity of feeling as though we need to get it back ASAP. Valkyrie seems like the ultimate safe mode, I am relaxed in it, bored too :C"

You may dash in for a rez or two, if you're not taking too many risks doing so, but most of the ult value will come out of you being far away, abusing your heal range and chain to pocket everyone without approaching battle. Of course there might be some dashes into Rez, but it may happen a total of twice in 20 seconds, the rest of the time you'll be hovering as far as possible from any form of action."

Yeah, call me whatever you want.Skill-less. Brain dead. M1M1M1M1M1. Rez bot. Pathetic. Boosted. Yes. I can't say these words don't hurt, because they do. However, playing Mercy gives me passion. Some may not understand it; I don't exactly expect you to! Everyone is different and connects with varying heroes. ^^ So, let me just talk about Mercy before her re-work.Sure. Hiding wasn't as fun...and fighting a Mercy who just hid, flew in, revived everyone wasn't fun either. What was though, was the intensity to gather enough charge for revive, constantly feeling on edge, healing everyone, damage boosting every ability to get your ult quickly. It made healing more enjoyable. Sometimes, we got POTG too, not always, but sometimes. It was nice...for at least one shining moment a support's love and work for the team was shown.I used to hear in the voice comms wonderful comments whenever I pulled of a big revive, and if not, my heart gleamed with satisfaction whenever I chose correct to do a 1 man...or save for 3-5! However...the Mercy rework has come.The intentions were perfectly fine. Though, all in all...it wasn't done well. When she first got it, I admit fully that she was so broken. Instant revive...then Valkyrie with it resetting, then on 10 second cd? Insane it felt! Then, they nerfed her...and nerfed her...to the state she is now in.I have not played Overwatch in a few weeks, for my lovely hero who I felt a connection with had changed, and my bond with her was then tearing apart. The slow revive...it is not fun. It really isn't. It feels like a drag to revive someone, and usually you can only do it when the enemy team is nearly all dead. Her ultimate...I feel as though I need to get it quickly, as before! However...I don't look forward to it as I used to. I know that I can do plenty with it...but it just doesn't feel fun. It's hard to hit her flying around...her GA is so far...her beam range just isn't Mercy. Then soaring in the revive comrades who have fallen on the ground in combat, up to only 2, then flying back up. Sounds incredible...but doing it is lackluster. There is no adrenaline. There is no smile adorning my face. It feels like I am just a bot now...as though the names I was called before were true. Now...when I look at the big picture, people still think Mercy is the best support. She was fine for what..2 years? 3? with her 5 man revive (at max). Now being able to revive only one every 30 seconds...having to stand still for nearly 2 which makes one an easy target...that is op as well? My eyes turn to the side when I play her. I don't get enjoyment as I used to. I look towards other heroes because it's not fun to play Mercy. I have had a love for supporting people...healing, reviving them, boosting damage, and being able to fly...those are all incredible. And for those wonderful gifts to feel no longer pleasent to fight with is a true shame.She was the reason I bought Overwatch...I guess she's also the reason I am now drifting away.TLDR; New Mercy is no longer fun. She feels like broken scraps torn up.Mercy development life cycle mediocre to fun to boring. Lucio already = boring I know Lucio changes been out for a while i stopped playing Lucio cause they made him boring. You want a cast time on a rez that is fine, but the movement speed slow down for an FPS like overwatch is a little over the top. With that logic roadhog shouldn't have been allowed to move when he heals..."

She's always been kind of a bot though because her throughput is so strong -- at least in my mind.  I think her and Ana sit very weirdly in the game.   Like somebody was like - hey here are some healers from MMO-RPGS - GO!  I mean I play healers in those game and Mercy has the same feel and I don't hate her -- which may be why. It's just wack-a-mole without the UI.  I still find that Valk has the same ability to be game-changing that big res did.  But instead of undoing a bad team wipe, you're essentially able to keep the momentum of a team fight or even give your team a second wind.  Which can be seriously critical for capturing a point -- like there are more times where I've seen(from my own team or against where we though were were going lose/win and Mercy's Valk just saved everybody's butts).  Again I think this is just a matter of taste and play-style though as some people hate it and others don't."

Sort-of. She's way more of a must-pick now though. The resurrection is in general horrible and unfun to play against.This is such a misconception imo that it's literally gonna end up killing this character. Rez (off Valk) is a utility tool that can be used every 30s and is not only unsafe to use, but it also means that Mercy isn't doing any healing while she's going for the rez - I will continue to say, people simply need to stop peeking at chokes or continuing the poking game when they earn a pick and dive the Mercy - it isn't any different from the Mercy having a mass rez back then. The only reason why Mercy is a ""Must Pick"" is because she's the only support that requires less babysitting from the team and her healing is not only the most consistant in the game, it's also unlimited resource. (eg: Moira) Moira would be a must pick if she had unlimited healing - hence why I said other supports are lacking. Also you wanna talk about unfun? How is it fun to get sleep darted and sit there contemplating wether or not you're about to get a beatdown? How is it fun to feel like a paper doll because Zen just marked you with Discord? Simply put, it's not, and people going after Mercy because she erased 1 pick is ridiculous."

I feel like we ended in the same spot pre-rework. Balanced abilities, too powerful of an ultimate. I dont want to go back to mass rez because i didn't liked how cheap it was- that's why i also want Valkyrie toned down, its too cheap it feels wrong.I've always felt like Valkyrie fits Mercy's Combat Healer character so well, assisting and helping as much as you can in the fray rather than just be helpful after the fight was done. Dodging bullets, enhancing your DPS... if you have to take things and shoot, its enhanced too. It just feels right, the abilities feel right, but for the balance it feels wrong to ult and still have 5-8s of ult after the fightis over"

Before hand you had to use your ult, which was a big sacrifice to make in case you needed it later, but now you can just valk and rez at your earliest convenience and you'll have the rez much more frequently.The excitement Mercy used to have is what made her a favourite of mine, but now I just feel like I'm cheating by flying absurdly high up. It'd be fine if this were a separate hero but this doesn't feel like Mercy at all is my point.Also the battle Mercy aspect is kind of a joke, you're easily sniped and are probably better off healing, damage boosting and rezzing than trying to run the risk of landing elims that your dps could be getting without most of those risks.If you like the new Mercy I'm glad you do, her ult is interesting and can be helpful. My only issue is this feels like they deleted a hero we all loved and gave us a new hero to make up for it without all of the aspects we liked from the deleted hero. They built upon who Symmetra was and it made good sense, but it feels incredibly different this time."

You have to also keep in mind that her poking people at -max- range is an uncommon case. Say she spends 90% of hey time damaging people that are between 0 and 15 meters, and only 10% of the time tagging people  15 meters and beyond.if you cut her range in half and double the potency of her mb2, then yes she won't be able to tag those people at max range, but for 90% of her play time it's just a straight double damage Moira buff.I really don't think she needs that."

With her dash / orbs, if she could tank damage with dramatically increased self healing and kill people that much faster with dramatically increased damage she would be the most broken 1v1 hero pick (except for maybe McCree with a good flashbang?).

GOD it was getting stale super fast over in the support section.I'm not asking for super fast releases. Perhaps just two heros at a time on this schedule.

I think it needs to stay a bit more true to the ""Quick"" part of it's name. 10 minute long 2cp games where it isn't very action packed until the last 30 seconds of the point isn't very fun in my opinion. I think it might just be the fact that it can go up to 10 minutes of a map/gamemode that the community does enjoy might be the problem. The problem also leaks into KoH where games can be up to almost 15 minutes. Although the KoH problem can't be solved as easily as the 2cp one where you can just award less time for the attackers if they get the point. I doubt this is enough of a pressing issue for Blizzard because they are currently working on fixing Competitive which is obviously a much bigger issue to them. What are your thoughts on this?"

Fast=hurried=messed up aim-Learn tracking, and aim around the neck or so.-Don't go after tanks all the time even though they seem better/easier targets-Focus more on supports, particularly those with predictable movements e.g. Zen, Ana instead of Mercy, Lucio-Don't tickle people. Get in, get a burst and kill, get out-Always have 1 blink at ready-Keep an eye on recall CD. You don't want to die realizing you actually had it the whole time-Don't engage face-on. EVER. Against ANYONE. Always engage from the side (it's also easier for tracking)-Don't underestimate anything. Thanks to your help, things that usually seem ""meh"" is a kill against you-Have a good sense of what kills you in one hit. E.g. Helix is fine, but damage-boost helix is not. 2 rein hits kill you, so it would be a good idea to get out if you got hit.-Actually a general sense of damage numbers help. E.g. Genji dash takes 1/3rd of your hp-Toss your pulse bombs like they cost nothing, because they really don't. Only save them if there's something REALLY worth combo-ing with-Don't always blame yourself. Crappy luck can get you killed by a multitude of absolutely retarded ways. E.g. Hanzo arrow from across the map hitting you in the heel and you instantly die.-But don't be hesitant to switch either. I'm around your SR, slightly lower, so I don't expect your Tracer to be significantly, hugely better than mine by a ridiculously large margin. It's often hard to pull off Tracer plays, so don't worry about changing to someone you feel more confident about.-Watch some good players. Dibbz is a highly recommended choice by many Tracer lovers.

Her blinks are well suited to blink into the shield, empty her clip, blink out again, reload, blink back in empty her clip, recall, empty her clip once more for a dead Winston.The only means of movement he has to combat this is shield dancing which will only get him so far. Winston is NOT a tracer counter. This is coming from someone who has played a ton of Winston. Can I chase her away? Not fast enough to keep her from shooting my support and bailing out....you do realize that characters are designed in some cases to be able to counter each other, right? Torb and Pharah, for instance. Why would you stand in the middle of your bubble? Stand at the edge, she blinks in, you back up and still attack her; it requires little aim for Winston to shock her a few times and force her to use her CDs. He's a tank. He's supposed to get hit and have enemies focusing him.As I said, if he's being focused by her, then it's less work she's doing because she's not killing supports. She's getting constantly hit and having to run away due to losing at least half her health per engagement, whereas Winston wouldn't be. Tracer has to dive, but a Winston can either stay in his team to protect from flankers or dive himself. I don't get why you people don't understand this. I've killed plenty of Tracers or made them back off, personally, as Winston. My team supports me."

Considering how long we on Console have been effectively shafted though, this was the best option I could think of.[Warning: Wall of text incoming.]If it was planned, from day one, to release the game on both PC and Console, then why are the concerns of the Console player base not being addressed, or at the very least, acknowledged? We had no choice but to buy the game for $60 (we didn't have an option of being able to buy the game for just $40 like PC does). This means that we are having to spend more just to be able to even get the game to begin with.Furthermore, we not only had to wait 15 months for a report system, but said system is super abusable. If you guys on PC think that the report system and automated bans is rough, allow me to enlighten you: it's even WORSE on Console. If we file a ticket with Blizzard as a result of a ban in-game on Console, we will be told that the Consoles have separate systems that Blizzard can't access, and will thus be told to file a ticket with Microsoft/Sony. If we file a ticket with Microsoft/Sony, they state that they don't handle in-game bans, only gamer-tag bans. This means that neither party knows anything with regards to Console in-game bans. Why are we being told to file a ticket with Microsoft or Sony, even though they've already stated that they do NOT handle in-game bans? Something has to be known from this so we can at least HAVE a chance to be able to appeal our in-game bans. Proof: https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759446940 Thread made by someone who plays on Console who has had to deal with this very thingThen, there's the 30+ things that we on Console lack (some of which are already on the PC version), and the extreme most part of those things which can quite easily be implemented. If all feedback is welcome, then why is our feedback not being addressed, much less acknowledged? Why are threads asking about when new cosmetics are coming being addressed, but not our consolidated feedback thread with regards to Console issues? A thread by the way, that has been going strong for over 4 months and counting. If elaboration on this is further needed, then I direct you to this thread here: https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20758447090?page=1EDIT (this was added on 12-19-17): Heck, there's not even an end-game for us. Competitive for us on Console really does not mean jack simply because there is no end-game. There's no OWL, Contenders, Open Division, heck; there's not even a single tournament that we on Console can even get that's hosted, much less sponsored, by Blizzard. Before anyone mentions it, yes I get that Blizzard has always been more of a PC developer than a Console one. However, they released the game on all platforms, and even had planned to do so from the very beginning. Therefore, this same care that Blizzard gives to PC, needs to be given to Console as well. Say someone on our platform reaches Top 500 and really wants to play in things like Open Division; what would happen? Would that person be forced to move over to PC just to have a chance? Simple little standard things like this really press home the second class citizen vibe that we console players receive. With all this said, can we at least get an update on when our current issues will be addressed please? We don't want our player-base to fade away completely because our feedback is not being listened to. The game started out very strong with the platform support, but now it feels like it just got dropped. I'm simply asking that we actually GET the value of the money that we spent on the game.If you read all the way up to this point, then you have no idea how much I appreciate this, because it shows that you really do care.Just to reiterate this again: I do apologize if this is the wrong way to go about this. We on Console have been shafted for too long now, and this was simply the best option I could think of to give our concerns.16 pages in now, and 3 weeks later...UPDATES:The ability for crouch to not be restricted to just toggle: https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760716093#post-13Ally aim assist for Ana: https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759487829?page=2#post-35"

I made this thread to let our voices with regards to our platform of the game be heard.Consoles have more convenience in them, and the vast majority of us have friends that play on Console, not on PC. We're not blind in this community. Look at threads that get a reply from devs in this forum (not to be confused with mods here). How many of those threads are PC related, and something small (i.e. when new cosmetics are coming)? Sure, it's not many, but it still has the better reply chance. Now look at the other end: the threads that are Console related, and something well researched/documented. How many of these kinds of threads get a reply from devs? Practically none.To answer your last bit: yes I already do have a job. The reason why I don't go and buy more games is because:1. It's made by a company who is known to have greedy business practices (I'm looking at you EA, main Activision (so as not to be confused with Blizzard Entertainment), and Ubisoft, to name a few). 2. Overwatch is still better than quite a lot of games that were made even this year (even despite what it lacks on Console). If I come off as somebody who sounds easily tilted, that may very much be the case (I won't deny it). However, not only did we still pay for the game, but a good chunk of the things that we've been wanting/needing, we've been asking since launch (that's almost 19 months ago now). We still are as passionate as you guys on PC are about this game. We aren't even asking for a lot with threads like this one, and Biv's (linked in OP), to name a couple. We don't even get something as simple as ""Hey guys, we hear you loud and clear!"" on these forums, even despite all of our concerns. Yet, there's threads that ask when new cosmetics are coming that get answered within a few hours, and in some cases, even as little as 15 minutes. Look at how long we had to wait for our Report System (and this is just to name one example). We didn't even get a reply about when our Report System would be coming until 8 months after the game launched (this was when they hoped to have it in during, or even before summer, you see). When we had asked for an update in July, we get the response of ""Soon™"" (again, you know what I'm implying). Now you have 14 months past launch and it's still not in the Console version of the game. The Report Feature was not enabled for us until the 1.14 patch, which released on August 28th. That's 15 months gone that we've had to deal with being unable to report glitchers, throwers, etc.. I'm not going to so much use the term cheaters in this bit; a vast majority of the cheating that had occurred on Console were people glitching into walls to be able to prevent point caps making it impossible for the attacking team to cap their objective. So we had people that could get away with literally anything and everything and we wouldn't be able to do anything about it.You also can't justify the excuse of ""It's because of Sony/Microsoft"" either. Games that have been available on Console have already had a Report System available on day 1. Heck, Fortnite is still in beta, and it already has a Report System. Hope I've cleared up some of our situation to you. Apologies if I've sounded critical on some parts. As I stated though, we are still passionate about this game just as much as you guys are.What are you not getting?!?I was not talking to you. My post was to someone else. I think i made that clear on my previous post. You just got offended because I gave someone a christmas solution and your butthurt about it.  since you dont want to switch and that is fine.

She could use it to help Ana into a better sniping position for example. It would also help her hide her teleporter or shield generator in different locations or help your teammates get to flank routes on attack.The cooldown for the jump pad should be about 20 seconds. Only Symmetra and her teammates should be able to use it. It should have the same health as a level 1 Torbjörn turret but made mostly out of shields since Symmetra has no ability to repair it.

Then there wouldn't be a loss of SR to make losing so terrible and off-putting and I could enjoy all the cool moments again.Just make a new version of comp that requires 6-stacks, receives the ranking icons and sprays, and CP as well.
