If it's one critique I'll have is that you need to remove ressurect from E and give the power to her ultimate or design a new E for her(damage % reduction ability on cast would be good).  The Mercy players obviously don't like this nerf and if you make ressurect too easy to cast and Mercy is in every match again you will have alienated everyone who isn't a Mercy player.It's okay to backtrack sometimes and a complete revert isn't needed but Ressurect has no place in this game as a regular ability."

But that won't stop me from giving it.The cast time is a welcome addition that helps give diversity to Mercys kit, making resurrect feel powerful in ultimate. The slowdown is counter intuitive to her mobility and her new core identity as a highly mobile hero with heavy constant healing.I say either lock Mercy to the ressurected target while she is casting so that she can still feel somewhat mobile and have a chance to dodge aroundOr remove resurrect as an E, up the charges in valkryie, and give us an upward mobility ability on E that could be replaced when she uses Valkryie.No character who's core identity is ""high mobility"" should be subjected to such a harsh slowdown.

If it's one critique I'll have is that you need to remove ressurect from E and give the power to her ultimate or design a new E for her(damage % reduction ability on cast would be good).  The Mercy players obviously don't like this nerf and if you make ressurect too easy to cast and Mercy is in every match again you will have alienated everyone who isn't a Mercy player.It's okay to backtrack sometimes and a complete revert isn't needed but Ressurect has no place in this game as a regular ability."

But that won't stop me from giving it.The cast time is a welcome addition that helps give diversity to Mercys kit, making resurrect feel powerful in ultimate. The slowdown is counter intuitive to her mobility and her new core identity as a highly mobile hero with heavy constant healing.I say either lock Mercy to the ressurected target while she is casting so that she can still feel somewhat mobile and have a chance to dodge aroundOr remove resurrect as an E, up the charges in valkryie, and give us an upward mobility ability on E that could be replaced when she uses Valkryie.No character who's core identity is ""high mobility"" should be subjected to such a harsh slowdown.

This was originally done to fix bugs on a couple heroes, but the changes are systemic and affect all Heroes.   Specifically, movement on the ground is much more consistent. Going up/down inclines will no longer affect the Hero’s speed.  Previously, inclines could either make you move slightly faster or slightly slower, depending on the circumstances. Inclines will also no longer cause a small amount of strafing movement when moving diagonally on them.   A side effect of these changes is characters will now have slightly better air control.   For example, Winston previously was not able to easily make small adjustments to his flight path during his Jump Pack leap, but now he should be able to do that, and it is also noticeable on many of the other Heroes that are often in the air.We think these changes will overall be great improvements but there might be some unintended side effects that we’d love your help finding on the PTR!Thanks!"

It didn't happen every time, which gives me hope that it's a bug, but I was working off muscle memory from playing current live Mercy (she's a damn chore to play now, but sadly my team still often needs a healer), so it wasn't an error in cancelling GA that caused it.

If you turn to escape you should have to put your back to them to try to make a speedier getaway while someone else covers for you. Otherwise you can just back up and freefire at the enemy."

This was originally done to fix bugs on a couple heroes, but the changes are systemic and affect all Heroes.   Specifically, movement on the ground is much more consistent. Going up/down inclines will no longer affect the Hero’s speed.  Previously, inclines could either make you move slightly faster or slightly slower, depending on the circumstances. Inclines will also no longer cause a small amount of strafing movement when moving diagonally on them.   A side effect of these changes is characters will now have slightly better air control.   For example, Winston previously was not able to easily make small adjustments to his flight path during his Jump Pack leap, but now he should be able to do that, and it is also noticeable on many of the other Heroes that are often in the air.We think these changes will overall be great improvements but there might be some unintended side effects that we’d love your help finding on the PTR!Thanks!I made a post in the forums about living in Puerto Rico and not being able to play Overwatch. I’d appreciate it if you checked it out. Thanks :)"

The leniency you get and evasive actions you can perform as Pharah and Genji is too much. Heroes that, might I add, for sure did not need buffs. Why allow people to be less punished for jumping in a direction? You jumped there, you land then, simple as. I don't want to see, he jumped there and circle strafed 327 degrees to avoid the several bullets i'm trying to put into him. Unnecessarily removing a game element that people have gained muscle memory for for over a year now is downright stupid."

These characters adjustingafter being booped and just losing all momentum makes no sense and feels so dumb.Have you ever played other games with actual good air strafing like Team Fortress 2? In games like that it takes skill air strafing to get back on ground after being bumped off from explosives and things like Pyro's airblast which is basically like Lucio's boop. I thought it was stupid that once you got booped you had almost no control in the air to try and save yourself.If you're using TF2 as an example, they've pretty much removed any strafing to safe yourself from an airblast off an edge for the exact same reasons, they were out of position and punished, they deserve that death, no matter how good they are at strafing."

If playing the same hero for too long gets tiring, try someone else. If soloqueue sucks, try to put together a team of people you like.

Check the meta reports.-People here also love to cry ""Genji favoritism!!!!"", which is a freaking joke.Genji got his hard-to-execute momentum bug completely removed. Mercy got her momentum bug made easier to use. Who's favored?Genji got his nerfs and Blizzard never looked back.Widow and McCree got their nerfs and Blizzard looked back eventually.D.Va got a nerf and Blizzard also gave a new ability to compensate, because D.Va main cries ""muh role purpose?!"".

Edit: I'm conflicted on the idea that those who are faithful to the game have probably unlocked everything and the duplicate factor has been refused (when I played this wasn't the case) so they've probably got everything so their odds for new stuff is higher. it makes sense to reward those who are keeping rooms full but at the same time I could only play for about an hour a day but am fully willing to pay for the skin to make up for the time I wasn't there for. It feel more like the game punishes you for not being a hardcore player."

"560","https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760636844","Different approach to the Mercy rework","Null","Hey everyone! So since Mercy's rework, i feel like she has become way too relevant, which has lead to some serious nerfs. I feel like after 300 hours of Mercy (both non-reworked and reworked) that Blizzard could have went with a different approach to Mercy instead of Valkyrie. So here's a list of changes i think is still not too late to do as some people isn't pleased with Valkyrie. I would love to hear people's opinions on this! Anyway, here we go;• Change Valkyrie back to old Ressurrect  - Keep new mercy GA ""angel jump"" - Give res a resource meter   - When mercy gets her ult, the resource meter will be at 5 ( max charge; indicates how many resses)This will make it possible to res your whole team within the time frameWithin 5 seconds, the resource meter depletes to 0 instantly. From there you can increase the charge by healing / damage boosting / doing damage / selfhealing. Table for charge needed for various res charges: 1 man res: 100 charge 2 man res: 200 charges3 man res: 300 charges4 man res: 400 charges5 man res: 500 chargesNow, obviously these numbers can change to range from 10 to 1000, completely up to Blizzard.Now you might ask about the whole ""hide and res"" ordeal which is what made Blizzard rework Mercy in the first place. Here's the idea; after 6 - 7 seconds of doing nothing (or hiding) the resource meter starts depleting very quickly (I feel like after 9 seconds the resource meter should be completely empty. Just like Moira's Biotic Energy lasts 9 seconds at full charge). This will prevent the ""hide and seek"" methods which every Mercy player used. When the meter starts depleting, you can still use Res from where the rate is. For example;If you're at charge 4 and the meter starts depleting to 3, if you Res before the charge hits 3, you will res 4 teammates. Now, any number or mechanic here can be changed to suit Blizzards taste, this is just a start."

But now people literally rage if you aren't constantly following them around and holding down left click on them, it's really sad how the easiest support to play is the strongest and how pocketing has become the standard as opposed to being able to do anything else with a support that's actually enjoyable for the player to do.Hopefully they'll nerf her for season 8 and we can move on to crying about Moira."

Did you save the game at last minute with your double rez when in valkry form she can escape enemy ults for 20 secs Anna wont be around a lot like Mercy she cant fly around to others and escape death many times  don't blame I am saying what i have experienced in the game and in this bull!@#$ meta that requires mercy all the time cuz of her outstanding kit you know i love Lucio and I stopped playing comp cuz everyone keep asking to switch off to Mercy but if go to comp i will have to switch at some point not playing the hero that I actually enjoy and see my chances with There is nothing wrong with Anna at all but you have to play around the meta its competing after all we should compete with the best picks and I don't like what I said but its what i see I myself play Tanks(d.va-monkey) i will say damn Anna missed her shot but Mercy would follow around with one click pocketing forever even from a coveri had once to switch off Anna to Mercy I was able to keep the team a life and healed longer than I was with Anna even if I healed the same amount so why blizzard wont think about a way to Anna to survive like giving her a hook like widow she is a sniper but she cant reach high places fast anyway i don't say that you have to switch when told to you don't have to do that at all its sad thing what I said I don't like the game like thisThe balances in healers make a different in a competitive game"

But now people literally rage if you aren't constantly following them around and holding down left click on them, it's really sad how the easiest support to play is the strongest and how pocketing has become the standard as opposed to being able to do anything else with a support that's actually enjoyable for the player to do.Hopefully they'll nerf her for season 8 and we can move on to crying about Moira."

Nothing. I don’t die every thirty seconds because I have good game sense. I beat a MOIRA in heals. That’s saying a lot. I would love to play Anna I enjoy her more But what if you have the more healing did you  win the game ? Did you save the game at last minute with your double rez when in valkry form she can escape enemy ults for 20 secs Anna wont be around a lot like Mercy she cant fly around to others and escape death many times  don't blame I am saying what i have experienced in the game and in this bull!@#$ meta that requires mercy all the time cuz of her outstanding kit you know i love Lucio and I stopped playing comp cuz everyone keep asking to switch off to Mercy but if go to comp i will have to switch at some point not playing the hero that I actually enjoy and see my chances with There is nothing wrong with Anna at all but you have to play around the meta its competing after all we should compete with the best picks and I don't like what I said but its what i see I myself play Tanks(d.va-monkey) i will say damn Anna missed her shot but Mercy would follow around with one click pocketing forever even from a coveri had once to switch off Anna to Mercy I was able to keep the team a life and healed longer than I was with Anna even if I healed the same amount so why blizzard wont think about a way to Anna to survive like giving her a hook like widow she is a sniper but she cant reach high places fast anyway i don't say that you have to switch when told to you don't have to do that at all its sad thing what I said I don't like the game like thisThe balances in healers make a different in a competitive game"

Considering how long we on Console have been effectively shafted though, this was the best option I could think of.[Warning: Wall of text incoming.]If it was planned, from day one, to release the game on both PC and Console, then why are the concerns of the Console player base not being addressed, or at the very least, acknowledged? We had no choice but to buy the game for $60 (we didn't have an option of being able to buy the game for just $40 like PC does). This means that we are having to spend more just to be able to even get the game to begin with.Furthermore, we not only had to wait 15 months for a report system, but said system is super abusable. If you guys on PC think that the report system and automated bans is rough, allow me to enlighten you: it's even WORSE on Console. If we file a ticket with Blizzard as a result of a ban in-game on Console, we will be told that the Consoles have separate systems that Blizzard can't access, and will thus be told to file a ticket with Microsoft/Sony. If we file a ticket with Microsoft/Sony, they state that they don't handle in-game bans, only gamer-tag bans. This means that neither party knows anything with regards to Console in-game bans. Why are we being told to file a ticket with Microsoft or Sony, even though they've already stated that they do NOT handle in-game bans? Something has to be known from this so we can at least HAVE a chance to be able to appeal our in-game bans.

If all feedback is welcome, then why is our feedback not being addressed, much less acknowledged? Why are threads asking about when new cosmetics are coming being addressed, but not our consolidated feedback thread with regards to Console issues? A thread by the way, that has been going strong for over 4 months and counting. If elaboration on this is further needed, then I direct you to this thread here: https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20758447090?page=1EDIT (this was added on 12-19-17): Heck, there's not even an end-game for us. Competitive for us on Console really does not mean jack simply because there is no end-game. There's no OWL, Contenders, Open Division, heck; there's not even a single tournament that we on Console can even get that's hosted, much less sponsored, by Blizzard. Before anyone mentions it, yes I get that Blizzard has always been more of a PC developer than a Console one. However, they released the game on all platforms, and even had planned to do so from the very beginning. Therefore, this same care that Blizzard gives to PC, needs to be given to Console as well. Say someone on our platform reaches Top 500 and really wants to play in things like Open Division; what would happen? Would that person be forced to move over to PC just to have a chance? Simple little standard things like this really press home the second class citizen vibe that we console players receive. With all this said, can we at least get an update on when our current issues will be addressed please? We don't want our player-base to fade away completely because our feedback is not being listened to. The game started out very strong with the platform support, but now it feels like it just got dropped. I'm simply asking that we actually GET the value of the money that we spent on the game.If you read all the way up to this point, then you have no idea how much I appreciate this, because it shows that you really do care.Just to reiterate this again: I do apologize if this is the wrong way to go about this.

I made this thread to let our voices with regards to our platform of the game be heard.Consoles have more convenience in them, and the vast majority of us have friends that play on Console, not on PC. We're not blind in this community. Look at threads that get a reply from devs in this forum (not to be confused with mods here). How many of those threads are PC related, and something small (i.e. when new cosmetics are coming)? Sure, it's not many, but it still has the better reply chance. Now look at the other end: the threads that are Console related, and something well researched/documented. How many of these kinds of threads get a reply from devs? Practically none.To answer your last bit: yes I already do have a job. The reason why I don't go and buy more games is because:1. It's made by a company who is known to have greedy business practices (I'm looking at you EA, main Activision (so as not to be confused with Blizzard Entertainment), and Ubisoft, to name a few). 2. Overwatch is still better than quite a lot of games that were made even this year (even despite what it lacks on Console). If I come off as somebody who sounds easily tilted, that may very much be the case (I won't deny it). However, not only did we still pay for the game, but a good chunk of the things that we've been wanting/needing, we've been asking since launch (that's almost 19 months ago now). We still are as passionate as you guys on PC are about this game. We aren't even asking for a lot with threads like this one, and Biv's (linked in OP), to name a couple. We don't even get something as simple as ""Hey guys, we hear you loud and clear!"" on these forums, even despite all of our concerns. Yet, there's threads that ask when new cosmetics are coming that get answered within a few hours, and in some cases, even as little as 15 minutes. Look at how long we had to wait for our Report System (and this is just to name one example). We didn't even get a reply about when our Report System would be coming until 8 months after the game launched (this was when they hoped to have it in during, or even before summer, you see). When we had asked for an update in July, we get the response of ""Soon™"" (again, you know what I'm implying). Now you have 14 months past launch and it's still not in the Console version of the game. The Report Feature was not enabled for us until the 1.14 patch, which released on August 28th. That's 15 months gone that we've had to deal with being unable to report glitchers, throwers, etc.. I'm not going to so much use the term cheaters in this bit; a vast majority of the cheating that had occurred on Console were people glitching into walls to be able to prevent point caps making it impossible for the attacking team to cap their objective. So we had people that could get away with literally anything and everything and we wouldn't be able to do anything about it.You also can't justify the excuse of ""It's because of Sony/Microsoft"" either. Games that have been available on Console have already had a Report System available on day 1. Heck, Fortnite is still in beta, and it already has a Report System. Hope I've cleared up some of our situation to you. Apologies if I've sounded critical on some parts. As I stated though, we are still passionate about this game just as much as you guys are.What are you not getting?!?I was not talking to you. My post was to someone else.

Blizzcon Q&amp;A:Any plans to make Symmetra more viable in competitive? Maybe healing abilities?Symmetra doesn't really fit well in the support category, but doesn't fit in defense either. In the future we might need to revist the categories to better accomodate changes with the game.Symmetra doesn't see much play in high competitive, but her recent toolkit change brought some interesting changes that made her more viable.Please, please, developers. It’s obvious you listen to us, otherwise a Talon Healer wouldn’t have been the next hero despite the massive demand for her. The community obviously wants her to be more supportive. Recategorizing her will not fix her fundamental issues when there are currently better, more intuitive options in the game for her niche (junkrat), as well as more supportive options for her niche coming as well (moira).From the Patch concerning her rework:""We wanted to address two main issues with Symmetra. First, on the whole, we felt that she didn’t feel active enough. Second, due to the nature of her Teleporter, she felt weak in certain situations on different maps and game modesTo address the first point, we replaced her more passive Photon Shield ability with a much more active ability: Photon Barrier. Now, Symmetra can help lead the charge on offense or help shut down a big push on defense by actively blocking damage for your team. For the second point, we noticed players would often switch off of Symmetra once they found themselves in a situation where her Teleporter wasn’t as useful. For example, when playing her on defense on an Assault map, players often used her to defend the first capture point, then quickly switched to another hero if that point fell. To help her feel more useful in more situations, we've given her an alternative to her Teleporter. The Shield Generator is just as important for the enemy to deal with, but is useful in more situations. .""This is important to note, as she is the most passive support out of all 5, and she is also the most situational. She is not viable on attack, as the intention of the rework. The first rework failed its intended purpose.You can read through this or skim to the bolded sections. While a lot of people argue that Symmetra is strong within her niche. That is precisely the issue with her. When she was most viable was within her Niche on chokes such as Hanamura, Eichenwalde, and Volksaya defense. There were numerous complaints on how hard chokes were to break through, so developers made several balancing adjustments, both to the maps, and characters who had either abilities or mobility to deal with the chokes. From that point onwards,  new map development gave a lot of alternative pathways and elevation that lessened her Niche's effectiveness and gave numerous easy options for counterplay, not to mention she’s not very viable outside of her niche, either.The point? The newest maps, newest characters, and newest buffs to heroes mean that her original Niche is shrinking, and her viability outside that niche is dismal if not compromising to the team. AKA: She’s not relevant to the current version of the game.The elephant in the room: She is the utility support, however, she is the only support whose utility mechanics are not readily available for use (speed, discord, damage boost) while the other support who has utility on cooldown has two highly active, flexible utility abilities that have a variety of uses that outclass Photon Barrier, and have less counters than her turrets do.  The other issue is that all of these support alternatives not only have better utility in their actual kit (not taking into account ultimates), but all the other support utility is in conjunction to healing. She was designed as a damage mitigating, utility support, that defends the backlines; however, almost all of the support in her kit comes from her ultimate, which makes her the only character who is balanced entirely around the merit of her ultimate- which is one of her design flaws, if this patch from Blizzard is any indication:Game-changing ultimate abilities were coming up a bit too frequently. This change helps keep them in check while still allowing them to be powerful. (universal nerf to ultimate charge)If a character is balanced around an ultimate, then it is likely that their kit is lacking. Symmetra has the lowest ultimate costs in the game, and can keep her ultimate up indefinitely. This should raise concerns as to what part of her kit makes this necessary in her design. They wanted her to more engaging in the rework, with more of a capacity for proactive and reactive engagement, but her kit has most of the most passive abilities in the game. Also important to note, if all of her her supportive merit is funneled into her destructible ultimates, she will always lose to Zen/Lucio, who don’t need their ultimate or to keep a structure alive to be supportive. Not only that, but her supportive capacity was originally her E, which rightly means that her original design did not involve a passive ultimate to provide support.Please, complete her kit. We know this is something you’re capable of doing. Within the last month, you completed Mercy’s kit due to the feedback of DPS mains. This is feedback from the people who play the character. Please fix her.She doesn’t  NEED  to heal, but she suffers from an incomplete kit as a support character. (if you need proof she's a support) Luminums videos show her potential as a support, but watching his videos often makes it clear to me that her kit is just not as cohesive as the other characters in the game, even the defense characters which skeptics seem to be convinced she is. His best plays are supportive plays, so she obviously has potential as a support. She just plays more like an offensive support, similar to Zen.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1GvmBQk8-shttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flWwBFCTjsUhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBbe7ylCy18(this was patched but shows how he needs high game sense, and to be innovative to a crazy level to succeed with her limited kit) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sJwuH1BMwY(this video shows the potential of team flanks at 4:10) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YhsywtY2OM(and this video shows why symmetra falls short as a support… she needs her team to support her for her to support them. She’s more follow-through dependent than any other support because she lacks support in her actual kit, but people will troll you because they see you as a “troll pick”) He makes great plays, saving his team from reinhardt ultimates, making team flanks, etc. But really, while that’s amazing, there’s not much he can do inbetween that except try to make picks. While other offsupports like lucio/zen, have their utility up (speed/discord) in addition to no cooldown, no ultimate options for heals (heal aura/harmony orb).Quality of Life adjustments for Symmetra are necessary, but if that is all she receives, she likely won't have a place in the game as the game evolves.The best, and most commonly suggested Quality of Life suggestions are:Turrets: Reduce the delay in placing and ""activating"" the turrets after you deploy them, as well as remove the slow that Symmetra is afflicted with when placing them.Ultimates: Let them be seen through walls for teammates, as well as willful deconstruction of her barrier generator so a skilled Symmetra can change her nesting location, similarly to how a widowmaker will change her sniping location. Let her deconstruct her teleporter to redeem some of her ult charge if the charges are running low. Also, allow her to build her ultimates on walls and ceilings at slightly longer range, so her setups become less predictable.(via AConstelle) Remove the 5-6 second delay she has on gaining ult when her Shield Generator is destroyed. The delay isn't there for TP, but it is for Shield Gen for some reason, and 6 seconds is a lot of time for Sym. Also the blue line indicating the Shield Gen's radius would be swell.Photon Barrier: There have been numerous suggestions for this ability. Increase the charges on it, decrease the cooldown, give her more control over it. The biggest consistent complaint I've seen with this ability is the fact that Symmetra has a harder time contributing with this support utility than other supports have contributing with their utility that is often on a lower cooldown or does not have a cooldown while simultaneously being easier skills to contribute with. This ability needs to be able to compete with an offhealing slot, period. It’s her only active support ability. The other point I want to bring up is that she is the only support who has a viable alternative to rez, which a lot of people are concerned about.[Moderator edit - I removed the direct call-out to the Dev team.  The Feedback here is greatly appreciated but the idea of the forums is a discussion among players.  The Dev team has access to the discussion and may take part in the discussion but the main focus is the discussion.  Not shutting this down just trying to redirect the focus :) ]"

More than anything it's to shed light on the issues that Symmetra is facing and how she's becoming obsolete with the evolving nature of the game. These ideas are the kind of ideas Symmetra players wonder about when they think of ""viability"" in the sense that other characters have that fall under the category of support, without boxing her into something as arbitrary as a healer. I've tried to limit the amount of ""reworking"" suggestions in this thread, but at this point, I'm leaning more towards it due to her place in the evolving nature of the game and competitive team comps. If you have an idea you feel is within her playstyle and will bring her viability, please list it in this forum. Ideas that have been thrown out:(Kyleesie Ideas)New Features to Existing Abilities:Photon BarrierChange the shape of the barrier into a sphere so it can block damage from all angles, and fully protect someone running with it.Health readuced to 900 down from 1025.- OR -Provides 75 shields to any ally it comes into contact with. The shields decay slowly 3 seconds after leaving a 5 meter radius of the Turret projecting the barrierReddit Idea:Let her place supportive turrets.(The issue with this is it’s not as flexible as other support utility and is too area based. Which in the end would cause the same potential problems as before)My idea:Her Glove as a Secondary weapon, similar to torb and mercy, unlocks a new ability under the primary fire of this ""weapon"": Photon Shield (yes, bring it back)Channeled ability, resource meter of 12-15 seconds. 30 Yard range. Grants 40 barrier health to your target per second. Can give up to 50 extra health. When not channeling, will degenerate at a rate of 5 hp per second. Barrier health is the same mechanic used in sound barrier and doomfists passive, which is why I suggest using this mechanic as a ""psuedo-heal"". This would grant her a place in the game as the only support counter available to Ana's grenade. She'll still primary play as a defensive dps, but this will give her defensive support utility that helps sustain the team and the main healer, without actually making her a healer. The way that barrier health functions, it would work somewhere between healing and the original photon shield. That is, that instead of providing a flat hp bonus, it would give a max of 50 ""bonus health"", but since it's barrier health, any missing HP would have to be filled with Symmetra's resource meter degenerating barrier health (like doomfist) before the ""bonus"" hp would apply.These suggestions, or variations of it, are the most popular on the forums. I’d even be willing to have her gun range nerfed, as lower SR seems to hate it, in exchange for more utility.Basically the same as her old ability, but not a flat hp bonus. Since it’s barrier health, missing hp has to be given before giving the bonus.Lastly, this is a quote that I really like from one of the other very well thought out Symmetra threads (Kyleesie's thread) that I really enjoyed.  This basically sums up opinion on why on why it may be necessary to give her a ""pseudo-heal""/stronger damage mitigation, while staying true to the developers vision for her. You don't need to make her a healer! That's the beauty of it. You just need to make her sustain to the point the team doesn't miss an offhealer :)Comments: I know the developers intentionally designed Sym without any traditional healing. However, while I respect their philosophy to design a unique way for her to function as a support, I strongly feel that her inability to heal (especially while classified as a ""support"" hero) negatively affects how players perceive her in the game. Simply put, Symmetra confuses people. New players are unsure of what she is used for, and veteran competitive and pro players don't value her utility over other support heroes who can actually heal. As a result, Symmetra is stifled by negative opinions, and those who choose to play her receive an egregious and unfair amount of toxicity and blame.Ideas added later based on discussions within the thread:Mohock Ideas: Letting her be stronger anti-mobility by having turrets affect things such as Dash/Blink, allowing her to set the base of her ultimate in a predetermined location before she gets it.Crestren Ideas: Allowing her to have more buildables, such as bridges, elevators, or structures that grant support to the team.Dr.Fate Idea:: Symmetra is granted a passive that gives sustain, similar to Lucio but exclusively affecting shield HP pools."
"635","https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759380928","[MEGATHREAD-UNCAPPED] Symmetras place in the game","Null","Here are some of my potential ideas that could improve her kit and make her more viable:Turret-Survivability:Give her turrets thermoptic camo like Sombras. The turret stays invisible until an enemy comes in reach, decloaks and shoots. After a few seconds out of combat they recloak again. This would allow for more flexible and creative traps and prevents Tracer/DVa/Reaper from shootgunsniping them across the map.Turret-Placement: Give her turrets the flying behavior like the shieldcore, but instead of getting destroyed by hitting a surface, the turret sticks to it. This would solve the immobility issue while placing them, they could be used to contest high ground more effective and they would be more viable to push a point. Bonus buff if they would start fireing midflight.Turret-Slowing: Slowing effects from the turrets (or Mei) could be applied to ""teleport""-abilities like Tracers Blink or Genjis Dash, resulting in a shortening of the traveling distance equivalent of the percentage the hero is slowed down. A 25% Movement speed reduction from one turret would lead to a 10,5m dash instead of 14m.Ultimates: Let her place the base plate of her ultimates in advance even with 0% on her ultcharge and activate them when they are ready. You would set up the base with Q and could change the placement at any time by building a new one in case you change your mind or they get destroyed. I would even disable their shields until they are activated so flankers could dispose of them quickly if discovered. Pressing Q with 100% ultcharge would bring up the same image as of now of the sg/tp and you can select to activate the existing base by looking up or build a new one by looking down towards the ground. This way, Symmetra players don't have to leave the battle for prolonged times to set up her ults at a good spot and they can be activated right as the fight breaks loose to get a better impact."
"636","https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759380928","[MEGATHREAD-UNCAPPED] Symmetras place in the game","Null","To Mohock: I really like the turret slow ability. Mobility is uncontested in this game, and that's why characters like Mei, even with a phenomenal kit, are scarcely seen in the game anymore. Improving anti-mobility kits, especially when tracer and genji are uncontested as flankers in the pro scene, might be something this game desperately needs."
"637","https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759380928","[MEGATHREAD-UNCAPPED] Symmetras place in the game","Null","Thanks^^I find it paradoxical that slowing abilities are way more effective against allready slow opponents but do next to nothing against mobile targets. The only thing that can counter tracers blink is sombras hack, i think this game could benefit from one or two more.My proposed change would apply the reduction to the momentum of a character instead of the absolute velocity. This would also make it better against charging reinhards, jumping winstons and rocketboosting pharahs while the immobile character interaction stays the same. To balance this change the turrets could get a little bit of damage reduced to emphasize the support aspect."
"638","https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759380928","[MEGATHREAD-UNCAPPED] Symmetras place in the game","Null","Turn her right click into a healing beam; or keep the ball, and increase its projectile speed to that of Zen, Mai, and Torb.  On top of that, slow down and increase the size of the barrier a bit. That way she can give tanks a small break when their defenses get overwhelmed. If they give her healing, she'll instantly become viable.If they do the rest of my suggestion, she should be some where between a tank, dps, and defense. Giving her team more flexibility on deciding if they want to got single healer, tank, or dps, without outright hurting the effectiveness of the team."
"639","https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759380928","[MEGATHREAD-UNCAPPED] Symmetras place in the game","Null","I've played Sym for over 200 hours and she's carried me from about 1700 to about 60 points away from Diamond. One suggestion I've had for a while is to add a simple 1HP barrier to her turrets, as a barrier will always absorb the impact from blow no matter how much it does. This would prevent them from being destroyed by something like D.Va's ult, Rein charge, Genji's Swift Strike, Lucio's Boop, Junkrat's Concussion Mine, etc. It gives Symmetra more staying power because there are less ways to counter her turrets, which are her main mode of support, but they still only effectively have 2HP so any automatic weapon fire can still dispose of them quickly.Another is that Symmetra just needs to take less time to do things across the board. She takes too long to deploy turrets, which then also have to activate so around 2 seconds from deployment to activation time for a turret which makes her harder to use on attack since she needs so much setup time. Her photon barrier needs to deploy earlier in the animation and closer to Symmetra, there are so many times where I have perfectly timed a block only to have the Hook/Flashbang/Widow Headshot go through it and then the barrier floats away from my corpse.I also think an interesting buff would be to either have her alt fire charge faster or move faster. She has the only basic attack that goes through barriers at range and, while useful in its current state, can sum up to poke damage if they have two healers. I think allowing it to either move or charge faster would give Symmetra a better chance on attack as she would be able to deal massive, unforgiving amounts of damage to the enemy team. These are mostly just QoL suggestions, as far as I'm concerned. The only straight buff is the charge or movement speed, and I think that's pretty minor tbh. The only serious kit alteration I could think would be to re-add back the photon shield at 25 and let her stack that with her shield generator, with the caveat that the 25 shields disappear if she dies. That would allow Symmetra to have a somewhat better impact before she's able to get an ultimate up, but can be punished if she were to die."

It also helps alleviate mobility to non mobile heroes (like Ana, Zen, Mei) so she can play a role in that and help her team move around better.

Teleporter = 3 charges Shield Generator = 50 shields ! Mini Shield Generator has half the range of normal Shield Generator! Cooldown: 45 seconds Whichever mini ult Symmetra builds, she can't use as her ultimate ability. So let's say you place a mini shield gen, you can only place a regular teleporter when you have your ultimate ability ready and vice versa. Our regular ultimate constructs retain their normal values. Minis can be deconstructed and replaced. All constructs can be seen through walls by teammates and shield generators have a blue line indicating their range. Also add stats for SG such as the total amount of damage mitigated over the match with its bonus shield health or overall SG uptime. I think this is a very logical rework and would fix her up a TON"

But to go back to my analogy, cellulitis can actually KILL you if you don’t get treated for it, and it gets real serious real quick (also fun fact! Repeated cases of cellulitis will leave your body permanently damaged and you need to take extra care.) When you know this and you have to wait as other people who came in after you go see the doctor first, you get a little ancy. That’s why I made the cellulitis comparison to Symmetra and why some of us are getting a little anxious with the lack of blue posts."

Whereas - Soldier 76 has 200hp because he has a heal, Pharah has 200hp because she can fly and is nearly immune to a good bunch of the cast, McCree has 200hp because he has a stun and high damage. It's the fact that Tracer and Genji have more map control to get away with the things they do that make them stronger (in the right hands)."

Whereas - Soldier 76 has 200hp because he has a heal, Pharah has 200hp because she can fly and is nearly immune to a good bunch of the cast, McCree has 200hp because he has a stun and high damage. It's the fact that Tracer and Genji have more map control to get away with the things they do that make them stronger (in the right hands)."

People like the excitement and is probably the reason people master these heroes, the energy feels good. Unfortunately they also come off as if they punish slower characters, since the slower heroes need good aim to take care of them. If they made it so healers and tanks were faster, we'd see a difference, but as it is now this is what we live with."

A good Pharah can destroy the enemy team and a good hog will make life very hard for DPS and healers.  Hog is the most survivable hero in the game because of his heal and damage reduction, so people may think he's a low skill pick.  But it's very easy to feel invincible when playing him and walk into the enemy team to die.  He also feeds the enemy ults very quickly.

And I have seen some people playing Mercy who really shouldn't be playing Mercy. Honestly I think the question of ""skill"" is pointless. If someone is in the same match as you, they have similar stats and the game believes you are similar in ability. They won't always perform at what the game expects but if you look at people's performance over time the game is usually pretty accurate.

Thus when comparing two heroes together they cancel out.Ofc every hero requires that - we're not denying that, but when someone is raging at a ""no skill"" hero when they're being outplayed it's often because they're either lacking, or not relying on those particular skills as much as they should be. Anyway from my perspective, and as someone with a lot of hours on ""low skill"" heroes you just shouldn't listen to people complaining about ""low skill"" - they're mostly just angry you're beating them.As someone who also regularly swaps heroes to try and balance a match I definitely have to rethink my game, my positioning, and my teamwork depending on the hero I'm using. As Widowmaker I rarely have to care that much about positioning - so long as I'm way back from the action and repositioning regularly I'm pretty safe, and effective at my job. As Symmetra I might not have to aim, but I do have to be constantly aware of where we are on the map, listening for audio cues, predicting which route an enemy will take, and deciding which ult is most effective and if I should disengage to go and place it, or if I need to stay in that team right. I also need to stay aware of our supports and try and protect them from flankers, or decide if it's worth me risking flanking myself. I'm absolutely not saying Widow is low skill - but I personally find her to have a more relaxing play style than Symmetra because I mostly need to focus on aiming and self preservation.I've lost count of the times I've been told by someone playing a 'high skill' hero (badly) that i should kill myself for actively countering or outplaying them. If you're a Widowmaker/Genji dying repeatedly to a Symmetra then there is something SERIOUSLY wrong with your positioning/teamwork/game sense. It makes no sense to stick to your 'high skill' heroes when it isn't working. It's pig-headed, stupid, and ultimately costs your team a win.For reference my two most played heroes are Mercy and Symmetra - and we all know what the forums thinks of those two - my next most played heroes are Ana and Widowmaker - I do just as well with them in the right situation - but I will switch off my 'high skill' hero for a better suited pick. The fact that I have more hours on Mercy that I do on Ana is because just about every game I have a suicidal Genji off on one side of the map, a Widow stood way back from the action, and a bunch of other DPS that won't group up with the one tank that we (might) have. I don't stand a cat in hells chance of healing with Ana/Moira (who both have high healing output) in that situation by design, but I can zip between heroes with Mercy. As Ana I have to try and laser focus on all these DPS all over the place and risk being ganked myself because no one is with me - and as Moira I have limited control over healing - those balls are great, but unless my team is grouped up I can't heal consistently with her"

They may choose to remain anonymous. They are still ranked as normal, but the system only counts registered individuals as Top 500, skipping past the accounts that did not, or could not, register. It's information Blizzard already has, but it would be unique to an individual. For example, Calvin would be able to register his main account for Top 500, but unless he took out several debit cards in different names (which would get him in trouble elsewhere), his other accounts wouldn't be considered because he couldn't register them."

As xQc eloquently summarized it, ""[bleep] a [bleep]"". I'm imperfect myself and enjoy watching xqc but you have to keep punk kids like him and calvin in check, as has already been done in part.The remarkable thing about calvin having 4-5 accounts and intentionally keeping them highly ranked is that he doesn't appear to be playing different heroes per account. I watch his stream a lot. Therefore, his ""achievement"" is meaningless. If you're say a top 30 player playing certain heroes at whatever proportion if you had 20 accounts rather than 4-5, granted enough time, they should all be top 100 and it wouldn't make you any better than having one account. It's how the skill system works.You're not really using your accounts to play different heroes, and you're not proving anything. Your dumb viewers and xqc can defend you all they want, it's not only wrong but it's also remarkably stupid. Top 500 may not be a big deal to pros (and xqc is far from a good one, by the way) and supposedly isn't a big deal to calvin either (now that's strange) but it's a big deal to many others. So how about you refrain from doing something dumb and insignificant that denies others pride and distinction they have earned?Anyway, this is something Blizzard should be stepping in on, along with the in effect boosting you can see on timthetatman's stream. It may be difficult or problematic to do, but there is no logical argument about whether these things are right or wrong.

If your a guy you're gay, if your black your a (you know), people who WANT to make fun of you will find anything and use it even if it doesn't make and sense.  So either mute them or ignore them and get on with your life. And if you can't like the rest of us you are just a whinny feminist who is looking for attention.:thinking:"

There are a ton of girl gamers out there and when ever we get in game and the guys find out we are girls the freak out and say harsh things to us. ( I.e. make me a sandwich, get back in the kitchen, and other fowl things that Blizzard wont let me put in here. Etc....) when we say something about it we are told we are a feminist or to emotional to play the game. I ignore it and report it. Don't get me wrong there are guys out there that defend us and we really do appreciate it. This needs to stop and there needs to be more of a punishment for people like this in the game."

If you want it to stop, tell the offending jerk to shove it, and if they don't, mute them and report them for harassment. Blizzard has the logs and when they get to your report, they will see the logs and handle that person."

People are people, what's between their legs doesn't make them any more or less entitled to anything.I've met loads of women in game that are actually better than I am, so people who say stupid things like ""all women suck at video games"" are irrationally stupid."
