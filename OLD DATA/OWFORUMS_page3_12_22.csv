SKILLRATRemember that hitscan aim is not the be-all-end-all of skill in OverwatchThat's horrendous game design. Game should always reward mechanically demanding heroes compared to heroes with low skill floor. But that isn't currently happening. A good Junkrat uses the mines to move effectively, but it takes more skill to move efficiently with the mine than it takes to teleport around or spam a double jump with the ability to climb walls - in fact Junkrat's mobility option takes away from his close-ranged firepower to use - something other heros don't have to worry about with their mobility optionsIT DOESN'T TAKE ANYTHING. HE STILL HAS 1 MINE TO USEGenji's dash to get somewhere atakes away his damage. Tracer's blink to get somewhere fast hamper her ability to deal damage at all since she needs blinks to get close to deal damage. Doomfist's rocket punch when used for mobility takes away his main damage dealing ability. Sombra's translocator when used to get somewhere leaves her without her main escape option on which she 100% depends. This is the only character that can use something to get somewhere and still have a backup charge of it to deal damage. Junkrat must choose where to lay his traps and where to throw bombs when he is using indirect support - he needs to manage the push and pull to decide when to advance and engage directly or even flank or instead apply indirect pressure/area denial - the better Junkrats seem to have a ""psychic"" sense of where someone is going to go and will already have a mine ready'Traps are not the problem. His spam is not the problem. Burst damage without any falloff in the entire blast radius done by his mines is. And he has 2 of those. Hitting with grenades from a distance directly isn't easy - it is a slow projectile and it's arc, like Mei's delay is just one more thing to have to take into account when aimingThat's why they gave him a high rate of fire and high damage to compensate for that. When his opponents are not stupidly feeding, the rat player needs to be canny and smart in order to maintain impact comparable to simply taking Tracer or GenjiHE SHOULD NOT HAVE IMPACT COMPARABLE TO HEROES WHO ACTUALLY TAKE SKILLA GAME THAT REWARDS SKILLESS HEROES OVER HEROES THAT ACTUALLY TAKE SKILL IS A POORLY DESIGNED GAMESeriously, just kill him from outside of mine range - like if Genji actually kill him entirely with ranged shuirkens rather than relying on triple shuriken to the face and or swift-strike like a crutch - you know, use that ""skill"" that Genji mains are always yammering aboutYes because there are not covers on every map everywhere.

Self damage would do none of those things.Winston can still counter him by effectively using his shield to mitigate damage. Plus leap into a melee gets some nice burst damage off on the rat.D.Va still counters him as she does a TON of damage to him up close and can easily close the distance. PLUS she still has DM...which made Junkrat useless back in the day as well.Also...Junkrat has no hard counters? You serious?

She's almost ALWAYS out of his effective range and impossible for him to hit. She's not even CLOSE to irrelevant!I'm not gonna make a list of the soft counters...Lastly, Junkrat isn't better than Reaper in CQC necessarily. Junkrat lacks something that Reaper has: Sustain. Junkrat can't really duel tanks but Reaper can. A Reaper is better equipped to beat a D.VA than a Junkrat ANYDAY! Junkrat can burst down squishies faster though. Each have something they do better.

He now acts a bounty hunter, taking down any targets offered to him, his current ones being Junkrat and Roadhog, wanted for Junkrat's secret treasure found in the ruins of the Omnium.Appearance: As a junker Raptor has a very similar aethetic, with weapons and armor improvised from scraps found in Junkertown. Knife holster and charging port for the decoy drone can both be seen on his belt. When stowed the rifle can be seen slung over the shoulder. Also has the Crocodile Dundee hat, it just feels very fitting.Role: A scouting hero, the whole kit is based around finding and helping to take down enemy defenses. Meant to counter Torbjorn and Symmetra. Can also be helpful in dealing with a Pharah with his primary weapon.Health Pool: Standard 200 HPWeapon: A lever-action rifle with a two shot kill range of roughly 20 meters, but then an inifinte three shot kill range afterwards with a moderate fire rate. Holds 10 rounds per mag. Hitscan.Secondary Weapon: Swaps to a shank, this allows Raptor to run at roughly the speed of Soldier's sprint and melee faster dealing 40 damage. Mainly intended as a means of moving faster.Passive: Awareness: All enemy builables and traps can be seen through walls if you are within 10 meters of them for a brief period or if you or a teammate spots it directly. These stay marked until the buildable is either destroyed, triggered, or relocated.Ability 1: Decoy: Sends out a small drone which projects an identical decoy which will move around and mimic fire, dealing and taking no damage for 5 seconds. Can draw enemy turret fire. 6 Second CD starts once the decoy goes down.Ability 2: Marked: Callout a single enemy target, marking them with a chevron listing the hero name and an outline that is visible through walls. CD starts as soon as the abililty is used and lasts as long as the ability, duration and CD still undecided.Ult: (No name as of yet) Raptor loads in a magazine of six high power rounds, dealing 300 damage, but the shots are now projectile with a slower fire rate. Lasts until all rounds are fired or player reloads. If you reload without firing a shot then you'll have 50% ult charge refunded. Callout for Enemies/Self: ""This'll put ya' down!"" Callout for Allies: ""You'd best start runnin""Legenday Skin Ideas:Anzac: Inspired by the Australian WW1 soldiers, weilding a more standard looking rifle and knife. Really thought of this one because of Frederick Bishop in BF1, turnt up rim of the hat to boot. Additional Respawn line: ""I'm an aussie, we're impossible to kill.""Primal: As the name implies, this outfit carries a very primal look, sporting animal furs with a bear tooth worn around the neck. Rifle now made of wood and stone primarly with fur covering parts as well. The knife's blade now an animal claw.Achievement Ideas:That's Not A Knife (Pixel): Score three killing blows with the shank equipped in a single life.Happy Hunting (Cute): Get four eliminations with the ultimate."
"115","https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20754915335","What Hero Would You Create?",NA,"Name: Fritz Real Name: Azimov Prototype 53 Nationality: Believed to have been created in a defunct Omnium affiliated Lab long ago in England. Age: ??? Role: DefenseStory: Azimov Prototype 53 was really the first of its kind, having been created with seemingly some sort of consciousness, though perhaps this was more ingenious programming work. He was the last prototype created. Azimovs were created to be a peace-keeping unit for every household, designed to detain any intruders without harming them severely and altering authorities of intruders. This one served a dual purpose however, in also being a caretaker of the young son of the rich, polite couple that owned him. His defensive purpose made him an exceptional caretaker.Unfortunately there had been some sort of malfunction with most other earlier units causing them to become rather hostile. Production was shut down and they were all recalled to be destroyed and sold for scrap. Amazingly enough Azimov had avoided detection by disappearing into the sewers of London where he has lived for many, many years avoiding people and the wars that have taken place. Though all the time down there can lead to unfortunate circumstances. Not only has his mind become addled, many body parts are starting to fall apart.Recently he left the underground bunker of his home in search of a new purpose as he has lost a lot of his memories. His data has become rather corrupted, therefore giving him the nick-name of Fritz. I imagine him as a senile, friendly robot.Appearance: Rusted, archaic, past technology. His left leg and right arm have been replaced with scrapped metal he found around the sewers. Still wears his old top-hat, though it certainly has seen better days. He's got an open hole in his chest where his rats have built a nest to live inside him for protection.Abilities:Handgun: A 3-shot burst laser pistol given to Fritz by the family that owned him for self defense when he ran away to hide.Alarm Unit: He can deploy a small alarm bot that will let off a loud siren should anyone get nearby where it has been placed. It alerts other players to the location as well as lets off a small stun on the player(s) caught in its grasp. (So mini Infra-sight+Stun)Rat-pack: He can summon a small army of rats to attack people for a limited time. The rats, however, will seek out Turrets, Portals, Mines, Traps and kill them first before attacking people.Ultimate: Haywire- Sends out electrical waves from the hero for X Seconds, damaging and slowing all nearby enemy heroes.A few Voice Line Interactions:Fritz: ""Hey there short one, you look pretty good firing those bullets."" Tbjorjorn: ""What?"" Fritz: ""I wasn't talking to you, I was talking to gal beside you."" (I.E, the turret. He hits on the turret. I thought that would be rather amusing.Zenyatta: ""An azimov prototype? I'm amazed one of you survived so long."" Fritz: ""Aza-mawhatsit now? I have no idea what you're talking about floating fellow."" Zenyatta: ""Well, mostly survived.""Fritz: ""Lucio your music is pretty interesting, but nothing beats Sinatra."" Lucio: ""Frank Sinatra? That's pretty old school man."" Fritz: ""No no, my pet rat. He serenades me every night."" Lucio: ""Uh..sure thing.""Fritz: ""Bastion, come here can give your old uncle a hug!"" Bastion: ""Boo dee doo doo!"" Fritz: ""What do you mean I'm not your uncle!?""Bastion: ""Boo doo doo bee doop."" Fritz: *Laughs* ""Bastion, you tell the best jokes.""McRee: ""It's High Noon.""

"117","https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20754915335","What Hero Would You Create?",NA,"I honestly don't know.  I made up so many classes but here's one that counters anti-flankers by having an ability that can pass through walls.  It's a personal skill and I thought about the ult giving her team wall pass through but it might be too OP.  If we look at maps like Hanamura, Eichenwalde, Anubis, Ilios, and Volksaya on top of heroes like Mei, Junkrat, Symmetra, and Torbjorn who can lock an entire lane by themselves.  Symmetra can load up a lane with turrets while Mei or Junkrat can spam down the other lane and choke and the problem here is it forces the attacking side to go through a bottleneck without much dodging space.  Sure Winston, D.Va, and Pharah can jump over but let's be real how often do people actually rush over the choke?  So this class is created out of a fundamental need.  I'm also working on a tank that would punch permanent customizeable lanes.  Due to being permanent there'd be a set amount of meters he could bore through during the entire match.  Symmetra would likely rig the new lane's exit so that would open up one of the original lanes for flankers anyway.   I included the backstory explaining the technology behind her.  I wanted them sufficiently advanced enough to barely pass for ""supernatural"".  Since she can fly and is hitscan (left click only, much less damage than Soldier) she can also dogfight with Pharah.  Just don't bring up Paladins they don't have a class that can get through walls and they don't even need one since flanks are numerous and wider generally and with far fewer mainway chokes.  Here's the art all the images tie in and the focus of the post is the pink fairy omnic. The big circle is the outside of the floating omnium where she's from and would be a PvE stage. http://imgur.com/a/6vNzeHeight: 4’6” Health: 125 with 65 sheilds and 60 normal health. Her tiny hitbox makes this low health balanced. Backstory: The flying omnium was created by a corrupted AI who was originally built to fight against omnics, but due to his superior mind was able to forge pico bots which are like nanobots but smaller and create his own faction that’s opposed to both humans and the current omnics (the current omnics are defeated by the time the flying omnium becomes relevant in my alternative universe). Swarms of factory type pico bots form a fine cyan mist so it appears that these omnics come out of nowhere. They gather resources on Earth to bring back to the omnium and break them down at an atomic level to rebuild them into picobots, which are smaller than human cells and are like the cells of these new omnics, who seem more like half energy half metal based lifeforms instead of actual robots for that reason. However, one omnic that was constructed inherited the original creator’s intentions and gained awareness that they are doing wrong. She was ambushed by humans but boomerang girl saved her life. Now they protect the city together and are on the flying omnium’s hit list. Left shift: phase shift-her picobots spread giving her the ability to pass through walls. 14 second cool down, makes her hurtbox bigger but translucent while keeping the soft glow.  Totally immune to traps and constructions in this state and can still attack.  E: Launch- She simply launches into the air and glides but falls slightly faster than Mercy and has no rocket fuel. Launching close to nearby allies heals them for 100 health. Left click: hitscan lasers. Handles similar to Soldier’s gun but is drastically weaker. A wand that shoots lasers. Right click: charges laser. This projectile based laser attack destroys projectiles, traps, and does small AoE damage (bonus damage to constructions) and healing.Ult: Since she’s meant to counter anti flankers something along those lines without copying Sombra’s ult. She's a new kind of omnic that's much needed as she overcomes some of the game's flawed map design. Sym sets up turrets on a flank, Junkrat watches another, so now they're basically forced to go through a 10 foot wide door where getting hit with 6 people's spam is highly probable, so she'd help make one of the lanes safe for Genji and have a skill herself to pass through walls."

Head of a group of bioingeneers, Warbeck studied the functionality of the human mind, and designed various patters of behaviour for his A.I. Using his cerebral implants, he created a perfect replica of his mind, and then programmed it to strategize for defense. Thus, Argus was born. The very first God Program. Argus, was meant to be the replacement of the English Nacional Security, but he went rogue, rebelling against his creator. It tried to merge his Mindcode with Warbeck's body, taking control of his cerebral implants, to create a perfect being, a human machine. But things didn't go as Argus planned. The assault left Warbeck in a state of crazed paranoia, with partial control over his own body, and very little memory of who he was before. He took the identity of Argus and left England, seeking aid. He asked the Cientist Council in Oasis for help, and in exchange he promised to oversee the Advanced Robotics Ministery.

It's 10 seconds but I always wanted it to be 8 seconds.These are just my thoughts.Ana needs Buffs, but all of those combined would make her seriously OP. I suggest 2-3 or them. Everyone thinks that Ana is in a bad spot right now, but the reality is that Mercy is super OP and simply Outclasses Ana. I feel like we should wait until Mercy is balanced until we start claiming that Ana is in desperate need of so many buffs."

She needs something that will increase her survivability, like shorter sleep CD and the casting time from it removed.And more healing is a bad thing because?Because she is already extremely good at it, she just doesn't do sustain healing, she does burst healing. So while she doesn't get the numbers Mercy does she can actually save lives in the middle of an intense fire fight. This change would give her good sustain and burst which is OP and would also bring back the tank meta. The only way something like this would make sense is if they removed the bonus healing from nade or made it only 25%. Ana does not need more healing."

Coming from CSGO I find it difficult to adjust ( As I normally play 1024 X 768 (streched) ). No, the answer is not 4:3 is an outdated aspect ratio. Even so, that doesn't mean it shouldn't be supported. I don't know about evryone else but I can only see benefits in adding support for 4:3 as well as 21:9. The only downside I can see is. Blizzard having to delegate some resources to this instead of new content. Even then, this should've been supported from the beginning. In conclusion, I think Blizzard needs to clarify wether this is an issue with the engine of Overwatch(idk I'm not a dev) or wether the support for these resolutions will come."

Not everyone likes playing every tank, dps, healer, etc. So if someone were to play with a Healer selection but they only play mercy but mercy is taken what are they going to do if they don't know how to play any other healer, If defined as a role select system it could be that they don't have to ability to play any other role so their basically useless for their team if they cant convince the other player to trade.Also this would lead to longer queue times and worse team compositions, Because what happens when one of your players leave, Its either going to have to fill that role which means your not going to have a player for a longer time than usual or its going to give you a DPS to fill your healer role.Defining this role selection whatsoever could help a lot though, because your just calling it by a name with little meaning. It would either Enforce 2-2-2 or be more like a preferred role system where you could select a role you would like to play and possibly one that your okay with player, and maybe even one you definitely cannot play or will not play. There's also the issue still of how your going to match these players together because its either 2-2-2 for the preferred roles or player defined as to what else they would like on their team, With 2-2-2 it would most likely end up with longer queue times, Which would be pointless to add to ""Quick Play"" if your just going to increase Queue times. The best thing you could do for a system like this is go to a 3rd party website or something like that, that will help you join a team of players willing to fill those roles along with you then you can 6 stack matches with these roles, all done by the community.Other than that they don't intend to shift the meta, ideally it would be best for every hero to have a counter, to counter someone, and be equal to most other heroes, but at the current state of the game and basically every past state you shouldn't be trying to win alone, you should be communicating with your team and to out play the enemies and win, but this is all optional."

Moira’s orbs and her long reach with her Biotic Grasp counters her in every way, all she has to do is keep her distance since her Biotic Grasp has triple the range and use her orbs to destroy her turrets.Aside from Moira... Pharah, Winston, Mccree, Mei, Reaper, Junkrat, Roadhog, D va, Tracer, and Torbjorn all counter her well. Improving her utility and survivability would help her a lot. Especially since they’re many other heroes who can do her job much better than she can. She isn’t even that helpful as a support, and I’m not saying that because she can’t heal.

I mean Blizz shouldn't even defend him on this since he is a toxic player. Someone like this doesn't belong in comp since not just do they hog the Top 500 slots, but also pollutes the game's community with toxicity by promoting this behavior. I believe his alts should be stripped of their Top 500 rank and just be GM without rank. He even admitted to which are his meaning that we know which to strip. I mean it's not like he should be scared of losing Top 500 on his main anyways. He may as well earn it since he can. I believe multiple Top 500 accounts per person shouldn't be a thing and that only one account should compete for a slot. I also believe big streamers like Calvin should be made an example of for calling people who complain about this ""retards."" He represents the game as much as the pros do. He's the one who partnered up with Twitch and decided to represent Overwatch. There for he should represent the game instead of staining its name. Leave your thoughts on this matter for I'm curious how others feel about this issue. SteevO was made an example for doing Bronze to GM runs, xQc was made an example of false reporting, and Dafran was made as the ultimate example of throwing. So I say let AimbotCalvin be our next example of toxicity for his selfish and close minded mentality of thinking he's better than others and treating people like they're beneath him.p.s. DO NOT WITH HUNT HIM, HARASS HIM OR OTHER RUDE THINGS. I'm expressing what I think should be done of these actions and only want to know whether others see his actions being something to punish or simply not a big deal. I believe this is something to be acknowledged and something for the  community to decide."

This type of skill difference would not be close to acceptable in competitive, so why is it for other game modes?People want to be able to play their games with other people who are close to their skill level. Otherwise it just turns into a stomp. And to add insult to injury the matchmaking takes way too long to find a game just to have this horrible result. I play at relatively normal hours of the day (6pm-11pm) but it ends up taking upwards of 2-3 minutes at times to find a game, in quickplay. On average it usually takes maybe 1.5 minutes.I can't tell if the game is dying or if the queues have become so fractured you can't even find a decent game anymore.Why isn't this being addressed?

You exist in a region, and that's all you can do.Posted by <U+0198>amuHer resurrect makes her the most needed character, as no other character can resurrect. You can tweak Valkyrie all you want, but if you really want to change Mercys pickrate, its by reworking her completely and scrapping Res.She could team rez during numerous seasons, and was seen as an inferior pick to whatever other healer.

The big rezzes were really fun, but I still enjoy 2.0's single rezzes because it can still be game-changing depending on who you rez.But the GA hop has to be my favorite thing about her. I first got into Ana as a healer when I got the game but found it difficult to keep up with high mobility teammates, so I tried out Mercy and here we are!Also, I just really love the Angel aesthetic."

Better survivability equates to better healing. If somehow they give Ana stronger options to deal with the Tracers, Genji's, Sombra's and Doomfists of the world then I'll go back to playing her. Until then I will ALWAYS think that Mercy is the better support healer. For me at least it has little to nothing to do about resurrections. I just hate dying."

I mean like, Overwatch is such a story-based game, why shouldn't there be a reason why the hereos fight? A Tracer killing Winston? Or even worse, Winston killing Winston? As you may already noticed, it doesn't make sense at all and still I haven't found an official explanation why that happens.So, let me tell you my theories about that topic :D (Please excuse any mistakes I make, English is not my mother tongue nor I live in an english speaking country)1. Overwatch itself is a training program for the hereos of Overwatch &gt; The hereos of Overwatch can train their skills without killing actual people (or things) in a simulation (maybe made by Athena?) to train their skills. Good Overwatch hereos can fight against good Overwatch hereos to train their skills and be prepared for a worst-case scenario (maybe a blackwatch hereo who can hack into the minds of people... who knows...)2. Overwatch, the game we play right now, is a game made for people to trust more into Overwatch&gt; Overwatch could be somekind of merchandise or... well, a game made by that Overwatch museum we saw in the original trailer to build up more trust for Overwatch. It's a well known game in the world and people can play with their favorite hereos, along with lots of ow merchandise and fan posters hanging in their rooms. :DI can't think of more reasons, what's your opinion on that topic? Tell me in the comments :3"

There are 3 people who are the best marksman, there's the best architect, the best musician, the best starcraft 2 player, and the best bodybuilder. You've got the best hacker, the best pilot, the best soldier, the best robot, the best heist crew, the best ninja and the best engineer.Bastion is pretty much the one exception to this, but he's just a lovable pile of bolts hellbent on petting animals and watching grass grow. So I guess he's the best at that, since nobody else does what he does.I guess what i'm trying to say is that nobody is really just some guy caught up in it all, someone to blend into the woodwork, the unmemorable middleman. Overwatch was made up of the best of the best, but Overwatch isn't around anymore. The world is troubled, and the common man just sits around presumably eating bits of sticks and scratching their heads as the world falls apart around them, and I keep asking myself, why? I propose that the next hero isn't that at all. Just someone to walk off after a fight that they didn't really want to be in. He doesn't have some flashy call-sign, or elegant old name. Just some dude with a gun who wants to go on with his life. All of his skins would just be like him wearing different t-shirts, his legendary would be just the same guy but wearing a hoodie or coat.That or an old-man in a red waistcoat who smokes a pipe and uses bees as a weapon.

Basically all of the overwatch affiliated heros are the 'retired' heros that have come to save the world again.2: We as players, would be left with a feeling of emptyness if we played this character. We wont ever get to experiance what this character would become. It would be cool if there was a character like this that would start bad but get buffed as the lore of the character was reveled but then they would have to start bad and progressively get better untill they are the best hero, or if they didnt become the best hero then the whole process of them being worthless to being average would have been worthless, because it was purposely designed that and it wasnt a mechanical accident (like when they change heros to make them more 'viable' like Sym.)3: It would be worthless to have a playable character to make all the other characters look good. As soon as a hero gets implemented thats ""average"" they would instantly be not average.

Plus these buffs are targeted more towards higher on the ladder anyway. So I’m sure minor nerfs could come with a change, but this thread is for buffs. 1. ReloadTorbs reload is painfully slow it is the third slowest reload in the game (I think) yet can be gone through pretty quickly. I would suggest lowering the reload from 2 secs to 1.5. It isn’t a super big buff, but it would get rid of that frustration. Secondly, his ult should have even quicker reload or unlimited ammo. Nothing is worse than you just shredding through your clip with increased firing speed, but having to take a 2 sec break in the middle.2. Head HitboxHis head hitbox is way to large. It’s literally like a watermelon. He just absolutely gets destroyed by mcrees, hanzos, and soldiers. Not to mention his head hitbox takes up a lot of his torso leading to body shots being crits. We need to lower the hitbox so it actually covers his head and then we’ll be good.3. Unhack Yes, Sombra is underpowered and needs a buff. At the same time though when a Sombra emps to push in I want to immediately core when I’m unhacked so I could potentially stop the push. But you can’t, for whatever reason it takes longer to unhack than you. Just why? It doesn’t make sense.4. Pack to upgrade This one is definitely the most buffiest of all them, but it is aimed at attack torb. People ask me what would make attack torb viable by the average Joe. I tell them nothing will, but this would help. Right now amour pack serves one purpose, to give armour (it’s kinda in the title lol), but I think it could serve another purpose. Throwing an armour pack on a lvl 1 turret instantly upgrades it to a lvl 2. This can lead to pushes with immediate lvl 2s or even lvl3s with core. It also would only help on defense when your turret is destroyed and it is a team fight which isn’t too powerful, but still good.So thoughts, anything to add, or think torb is fine. This post will probably get downvoted, but we have to face it, he needs a buff."

So you end up gliding out to the point and getting killed by an enemy you can't see.Mystery Heroes is the worst culprit at this as every game usually starts with the invisible heroes, except the pre-match countdown allows enough time for the heroes to render.POTGs are also broken in this way.

If you have good aim and game sense, Mei can counter Tracer, purely because her alternate fire will 1 shot Tracer if the headshot is landed. It is normally pointless trying to freeze Tracer, she will always have a blink or her rewind up and ready to escape. However this is not always the case since relying on the ability to land headshots on a Tracer will eventually fail you. Tracer is simply that overpowered in the current state of the gameAs for Genji, he just has way to many ways to escape from Mei. The slow projectile speed of Mei's primary fire makes it a nightmare to actually connect and freeze him when he's spamming double jump, and on top of that, Genji has his dash which takes him well out of range of Mei, while also going in any direction the Genji chooses. Luckily if the Genji messes up his dash, there's nothing much he can do against you."

You can't just expect to fully freeze enemies and pick them off with an icicle to the head. Mei slowing heroes down with her gun makes it easier for teammates to shoot the affected enemy. So communicate with your team when you are freezing enemies and it will make Mei much more effective.Also buffing her primary fire so that it disables mobility abilities is just broken and puts Sombra out of the job."

It is also worth mentioning that trying to force players to cooperate or trying to force a good team composition will never help, it will only make things worse and make the teamwork and cooperation decay faster.So just remember to be polite, try to be as kind as possible to your team, even if they do not return that kindness. Every little bit you can do to show your team that you are willing to cooperate helps, and every little bit of that make things get easier.Also, I am not sure about it being against the law to share video proof of something like this.
