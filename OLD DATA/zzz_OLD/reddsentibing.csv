These problems have largely been solved in modern games and operating systems, so there is generally very little reason to opt for borderless windowed anymore if you're playing on the whole size of your monitor.With that background out of the way, we can move on to your question.  Yes, you are losing those full screen optimizations running in windowed mode, but this is vastly overshadowed by the fact that your graphics processor needs to render fewer pixels due to the lowered effective screen resolution your game is playing at.  This makes a huge difference.  If every frame is that much smaller (in resolution) it's much easier for a system under strain to make more of them, faster.

Try out all the different heroes so you at least get a feel for what their kits do. After that, see which ones you like and focus on them. Most of the skills you need for overwatch will just naturally come with time and experience. Try to hone your general awareness, whether that be listening to what's going on around you, what threats are present, looking at the kill feed to see how your team is faring, what ults your team has up, what ults the enemy team might have up, etc. Having good awareness will lead to having good game sense.Always try to play the objective, the objective is the number one priority and it is also what many newer players neglect. Learn how to analyse the objective timer as it can be confusing to understand for beginners. For example, overtime will start to tick if you guys are on 99% and the other team is on 0 but still contesting. Whilst your gut reaction may be to panic and try to touch point - that is often the wrong decision. Instead, realise that your team only needs 1% more and it is ok to let the enemy cap the point in order to regroup as a team and push together. On the flip side, recognise which overtimes mean TOUCH the point and STAY on the point using whatever means possible. It is all too common to pull a c9 - meaning that a team has the opportunity to contest the point but don't do so and lose the game. If you notice that your team is pushed all the way up but the point hasn't been capped, sit on the point and cap it yourself. If you notice there is nobody on payload, let your team know or sit on it yourself. Trickling is BAD. Don't trickle, don't let your team trickle, spam that group up button when you notice people are just going onto the point one by one and dying. Sorry about the long ass essay, I'm on a flight atm so I have a lot of time.

There is one objective and it’s abundtly clear what that is.   I get through the game no big deal I’ll take the loss.  Then I’m grouped up with the same shitty ass party as before.  Neither takes healer, and we get absolutely smoked for the 2nd time in a row.  In both games I led in eliminations, damage, objective kills and healing.   How does this happen? I know what you guys are going to say.  “Get Gud”.  Well guess what, shut the fuck up.  I’ve demonstrated time and time again that I am good, and it is imperative that your team mates aren’t retarded. Fucking bullshit. ",1,"winning",1,0,1,-0.333333333333333,"TRUE"

I had originally written it for /r/overwatchuniversity (but had also always intended for /u/vandalmunroe to use it for his website) and people there were saying that 'communication is a net negative,' so I wrote a 'small' edit to my original post. I'll copy it here in case anyone wants to read that as well. In the comments, some people have been saying that they have felt that communicating only tends to tilt people. This can be because of a variety of things. Those people could have already been tilted and are venting their frustrations on the 'tryhard' (shouldn't we all be tryharding in competitive?) for example. It could also be that the player who is communicating is being too condescending or argumentative about it (often without realizing it) even though they do mean well. Then there is also the fact that some people are just playing their own game and have next to zero interest in actually working with their team, which (to me) is entirely the wrong way of going about a competitive OW game.If you queue up in competitive (which is by all accounts the most 'serious' way of playing the game for most players) in Overwatch, which is a multiplayer only team based game, I think that there should be a certain willingness to be a team player and work with your team. I am not saying that people should be playing heroes they really don't want to play or have no playtime on and be the lackey of their team, but there is a middle ground between that and blatantly ignoring the input of your team and just doing whatever the hell you want, including getting mad when someone does want to work as a team. This is partially covered in the 'mind your attitude' part of the guide though.Either way: it is important to get a feel for your team. If a certain player really doesn't handle your suggestion to switch off well then it's probably best to leave it at that, for example. Millions of people play this game and as such there's tons of different personality types behind those screens. Much as in real life it's important that you are able to 'read the room'.It is also possible to 'force yourself' on your team too hard. It is fine to communicate regular stuff (basic health callouts, ults, ...) but if you try to babysit your team a little too hard then there's a possibility that that doesn't sit well with the enemy team. Remember that no one elected you as their leader, so it's not your responsibility to steer the team and have all of them play to your ideas. If you are calling the shots a bit and people are listening and agreeing, then great, keep doing that. But if you feel like your team wants to go a different route then go along with the team. It's a team game, there is no set hierarchy, you're all on the same level of the leadership pyramid.There is also definitely the possibility that you are communicating too much. As with almost anything, moderation is key. There's no need to call out that McCree used his roll when he exited spawn, or that Tracer used one blink, for example. Aside from that, some groups of people naturally prefer a more laid back style of comms (just saying whatever is really necessary) whilst some will have no problem with a more 'professional' style of communication. Again; reading the room is important.Edit conclusionI don't want to pull any rank card or sound like a grandpa, but I've been playing competitive games for the better part of a decade now and communication is something which leads to good results (or at least causes no extra troubles) 95% of the time in my opinion. It's definitely very important to 'read the room' when you're playing with randoms though, and that is a skill that will come with time. Some people are 'beyond help' (people who are already tilted from a loss streak, very selfish/arrogant players, trolls, ...) but that's just the nature of people, that's not a downside of communicating in itself.It is important to also look at yourself as well. If you find that more than half of your teammates get angry with you after a while then it's probably best to take a look at how exactly you're communicating. No matter how well you mean it, you could be coming off as a smug bastard to them or you could be yelling stuff which really doesn't matter at all.All in all I firmly believe that being able to communicate properly (which also means knowing what you can and can't say to certain teammates and so on) is a very valuable skill. You don't have to be talking all the time (I don't do that either) and as with everything there are nuances to it. You're playing with real people with real feelings and personalities after all, not with robots. Some people prefer to be silent and just listen in and that's fine as well, but I wholeheartedly disagree with the notion that getting on comms somehow always (or the majority of the time) has a negative effect on your team. That doesn't rhyme with my experiences and it doesn't rhyme with what I see on the streams I watch every day either.",1,"negative",-1,0,1,0.233333333333333,"FALSE"

I'm of the opinion that it's always better to at least make super necessary callouts (like a flanking Reaper with ult or whatever who hasn't been seen by anyone in your team) but I understand that there are people who'd rather not talk due to a variety of reasons. Completely shutting off the chat of other people by default is something which I think is rather silly though. Initially it might help you to focus on your game if you just turn everything off, but remember that OW is a team game and you team's input can genuinely mean the difference between winning or losing a game.I also think that being able to listen to team chat whilst playing the game is a skill which needs to be trained before you can do it perfectly. If it's really so beneficial to just mute everything then why don't pro teams do that, for instance? Another comment on here went something along the lines of 'how is communicating with my team gonna help me win a 1v1 with a flanker' and the answer is that it won't help you win that 1v1 in that instance (though communicating it may save your life due to someone peeling for you or whatever) but to me that's a bit of a lazy (I don't mean that offensively) way of thinking. For example; I play soccer. Why would I try to look up at the field as often as possible when running with the bal when I can just look at my feet the entire team, making it way easier? This just to say that, yes, it might be easier to look at your feet, but you'll lose valuable info on the position of your teammates and the opposition. Once you've practiced enough it becomes second nature to look up as much as possible as opposed to looking at your feet.The same goes for OW. Yeah, it might be easier to shut everything off and 'just focus on your own play' but that comes at the cost of not hearing possible gamesaving calls, not being able to call out very important stuff which can win you games, ... I've been gaming for a long time and now I can easily talk and listen to other players without it being a major hindrance to me. You can look at players like Emongg if you want an example of a player who is constantly talking and listening and still performing very well. Now of course if your team consists of a bunch of trolls blaring music and farting noises through their mics whilst raging at each other then you can turn it all off, but I think shutting off communications entirely by default isn't the right way to go. TL;DR: I'd say shutting off all comms by default is a mistake. It might be easier for you to play without all of these 'distractions' but once you get used to it it's not a distraction any longer. Perhaps a silly example to illustrate my point: it's easier to ride a bike with training wheels because you're not being distracted by the whole 'trying to stay upright' thing, but if you want to become a decent/pro cyclist you're gonna have to take off the training wheels sooner or later.",1,"better",1,0,1,0.314285714285714,"FALSE"

As a general rule of thumb you should try to never react to something and let your frustration shine through. Creating a bad vibe in a team is the shortest way to a loss, because tilted people will always play worse. If your Mercy blatantly missed your multiple calls for healing and you were standing right next to her then you have every right to be a little upset, but don't let it shine through in your comms too much. It's okay to tell someone you think they did something wrong (and you should be able to take constructive criticism as a player in a competitive game mode) but never resort to flaming or any sort of abuse.

It seems like for many games, there are people who do nothing in life but play them and many of them get some sort of money.  While this can be based on them being good at the game or at gaming in general, other times its because they arent good at anything else.  I recall XQC having a deep talk about how he has invested so much into playing games because he isnt good with math and he isnt good with other things that most normal people are, and that he has to put all his time into gaming because if not then he will never find work since games ARE the only thing he is good with.  Without making money from gaming, he will have nothing to put on a resume that has any real worth to it if things dont work out for him in the gaming world.Honestly, I think the idea of gaming for life is a really risky idea.  Most people who are pro gamers are very young but when they get older, the new generation of young gamers will push them to their limits and soon they will be replaced.  Now what do they do with their lifes?   I mean sure playing games sounds more fun than doing engineering work, like what I do, but my work contributes to society and my job security is very safe since finding work as an engineer is not too hard (well, its hard at first but once you get going, its not that bad).",1,"like",1,0,1,0.523809523809524,"FALSE"
