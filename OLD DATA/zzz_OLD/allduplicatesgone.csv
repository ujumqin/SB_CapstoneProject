"95","I honestly don't know.  I made up so many classes but here's one that counters anti-flankers by having an ability that can pass through walls.  It's a personal skill and I thought about the ult giving her team wall pass through but it might be too OP.  If we look at maps like Hanamura, Eichenwalde, Anubis, Ilios, and Volksaya on top of heroes like Mei, Junkrat, Symmetra, and Torbjorn who can lock an entire lane by themselves.  Symmetra can load up a lane with turrets while Mei or Junkrat can spam down the other lane and choke and the problem here is it forces the attacking side to go through a bottleneck without much dodging space.  Sure Winston, D.Va, and Pharah can jump over but let's be real how often do people actually rush over the choke?  So this class is created out of a fundamental need.  I'm also working on a tank that would punch permanent customizeable lanes.  Due to being permanent there'd be a set amount of meters he could bore through during the entire match.  Symmetra would likely rig the new lane's exit so that would open up one of the original lanes for flankers anyway.   I included the backstory explaining the technology behind her.  I wanted them sufficiently advanced enough to barely pass for ""supernatural"".  Since she can fly and is hitscan (left click only, much less damage than Soldier) she can also dogfight with Pharah.  Just don't bring up Paladins they don't have a class that can get through walls and they don't even need one since flanks are numerous and wider generally and with far fewer mainway chokes.  Here's the art all the images tie in and the focus of the post is the pink fairy omnic. The big circle is the outside of the floating omnium where she's from and would be a PvE stage. http://imgur.com/a/6vNzeHeight: 4’6” Health: 125 with 65 sheilds and 60 normal health. Her tiny hitbox makes this low health balanced. Backstory: The flying omnium was created by a corrupted AI who was originally built to fight against omnics, but due to his superior mind was able to forge pico bots which are like nanobots but smaller and create his own faction that’s opposed to both humans and the current omnics (the current omnics are defeated by the time the flying omnium becomes relevant in my alternative universe). Swarms of factory type pico bots form a fine cyan mist so it appears that these omnics come out of nowhere. They gather resources on Earth to bring back to the omnium and break them down at an atomic level to rebuild them into picobots, which are smaller than human cells and are like the cells of these new omnics, who seem more like half energy half metal based lifeforms instead of actual robots for that reason. However, one omnic that was constructed inherited the original creator’s intentions and gained awareness that they are doing wrong. She was ambushed by humans but boomerang girl saved her life. Now they protect the city together and are on the flying omnium’s hit list. Left shift: phase shift-her picobots spread giving her the ability to pass through walls. 14 second cool down, makes her hurtbox bigger but translucent while keeping the soft glow.  Totally immune to traps and constructions in this state and can still attack.  E: Launch- She simply launches into the air and glides but falls slightly faster than Mercy and has no rocket fuel. Launching close to nearby allies heals them for 100 health. Left click: hitscan lasers. Handles similar to Soldier’s gun but is drastically weaker. A wand that shoots lasers. Right click: charges laser. This projectile based laser attack destroys projectiles, traps, and does small AoE damage (bonus damage to constructions) and healing.Ult: Since she’s meant to counter anti flankers something along those lines without copying Sombra’s ult. She's a new kind of omnic that's much needed as she overcomes some of the game's flawed map design. Sym sets up turrets on a flank, Junkrat watches another, so now they're basically forced to go through a 10 foot wide door where getting hit with 6 people's spam is highly probable, so she'd help make one of the lanes safe for Genji and have a skill herself to pass through walls.",0.136363636363636,"FALSE"

"98","My idea for a hero copied and pasted from another thread:Name: Raptor (Meant in the sense of a bird of prey, trying to keep in theme of both animal themed Junker names but also the hunter aspect)Backstory: A junker who was a big game hunter prior to the explosion at the Australian Omnium. He now acts a bounty hunter, taking down any targets offered to him, his current ones being Junkrat and Roadhog, wanted for Junkrat's secret treasure found in the ruins of the Omnium.Appearance: As a junker Raptor has a very similar aethetic, with weapons and armor improvised from scraps found in Junkertown. Knife holster and charging port for the decoy drone can both be seen on his belt. When stowed the rifle can be seen slung over the shoulder. Also has the Crocodile Dundee hat, it just feels very fitting.Role: A scouting hero, the whole kit is based around finding and helping to take down enemy defenses. Meant to counter Torbjorn and Symmetra. Can also be helpful in dealing with a Pharah with his primary weapon.Health Pool: Standard 200 HPWeapon: A lever-action rifle with a two shot kill range of roughly 20 meters, but then an inifinte three shot kill range afterwards with a moderate fire rate. Holds 10 rounds per mag. Hitscan.Secondary Weapon: Swaps to a shank, this allows Raptor to run at roughly the speed of Soldier's sprint and melee faster dealing 40 damage. Mainly intended as a means of moving faster.Passive: Awareness: All enemy builables and traps can be seen through walls if you are within 10 meters of them for a brief period or if you or a teammate spots it directly. These stay marked until the buildable is either destroyed, triggered, or relocated.Ability 1: Decoy: Sends out a small drone which projects an identical decoy which will move around and mimic fire, dealing and taking no damage for 5 seconds. Can draw enemy turret fire. 6 Second CD starts once the decoy goes down.Ability 2: Marked: Callout a single enemy target, marking them with a chevron listing the hero name and an outline that is visible through walls. CD starts as soon as the abililty is used and lasts as long as the ability, duration and CD still undecided.Ult: (No name as of yet) Raptor loads in a magazine of six high power rounds, dealing 300 damage, but the shots are now projectile with a slower fire rate. Lasts until all rounds are fired or player reloads. If you reload without firing a shot then you'll have 50% ult charge refunded. Callout for Enemies/Self: ""This'll put ya' down!"" Callout for Allies: ""You'd best start runnin""Legenday Skin Ideas:Anzac: Inspired by the Australian WW1 soldiers, weilding a more standard looking rifle and knife. Really thought of this one because of Frederick Bishop in BF1, turnt up rim of the hat to boot. Additional Respawn line: ""I'm an aussie, we're impossible to kill.""Primal: As the name implies, this outfit carries a very primal look, sporting animal furs with a bear tooth worn around the neck. Rifle now made of wood and stone primarly with fur covering parts as well. The knife's blade now an animal claw.Achievement Ideas:That's Not A Knife (Pixel): Score three killing blows with the shank equipped in a single life.Happy Hunting (Cute): Get four eliminations with the ultimate.",-0.266666666666667,"TRUE"

"100","Name: Fritz Real Name: Azimov Prototype 53 Nationality: Believed to have been created in a defunct Omnium affiliated Lab long ago in England. Age: ??? Role: DefenseStory: Azimov Prototype 53 was really the first of its kind, having been created with seemingly some sort of consciousness, though perhaps this was more ingenious programming work. He was the last prototype created. Azimovs were created to be a peace-keeping unit for every household, designed to detain any intruders without harming them severely and altering authorities of intruders. This one served a dual purpose however, in also being a caretaker of the young son of the rich, polite couple that owned him. His defensive purpose made him an exceptional caretaker.Unfortunately there had been some sort of malfunction with most other earlier units causing them to become rather hostile. Production was shut down and they were all recalled to be destroyed and sold for scrap. Amazingly enough Azimov had avoided detection by disappearing into the sewers of London where he has lived for many, many years avoiding people and the wars that have taken place. Though all the time down there can lead to unfortunate circumstances. Not only has his mind become addled, many body parts are starting to fall apart.Recently he left the underground bunker of his home in search of a new purpose as he has lost a lot of his memories. His data has become rather corrupted, therefore giving him the nick-name of Fritz. I imagine him as a senile, friendly robot.Appearance: Rusted, archaic, past technology. His left leg and right arm have been replaced with scrapped metal he found around the sewers. Still wears his old top-hat, though it certainly has seen better days. He's got an open hole in his chest where his rats have built a nest to live inside him for protection.Abilities:Handgun: A 3-shot burst laser pistol given to Fritz by the family that owned him for self defense when he ran away to hide.Alarm Unit: He can deploy a small alarm bot that will let off a loud siren should anyone get nearby where it has been placed. It alerts other players to the location as well as lets off a small stun on the player(s) caught in its grasp. (So mini Infra-sight+Stun)Rat-pack: He can summon a small army of rats to attack people for a limited time. The rats, however, will seek out Turrets, Portals, Mines, Traps and kill them first before attacking people.Ultimate: Haywire- Sends out electrical waves from the hero for X Seconds, damaging and slowing all nearby enemy heroes.A few Voice Line Interactions:Fritz: ""Hey there short one, you look pretty good firing those bullets."" Tbjorjorn: ""What?"" Fritz: ""I wasn't talking to you, I was talking to gal beside you."" (I.E, the turret. He hits on the turret.

Head of a group of bioingeneers, Warbeck studied the functionality of the human mind, and designed various patters of behaviour for his A.I. Using his cerebral implants, he created a perfect replica of his mind, and then programmed it to strategize for defense. Thus, Argus was born. The very first God Program. Argus, was meant to be the replacement of the English Nacional Security, but he went rogue, rebelling against his creator. It tried to merge his Mindcode with Warbeck's body, taking control of his cerebral implants, to create a perfect being, a human machine. But things didn't go as Argus planned. The assault left Warbeck in a state of crazed paranoia, with partial control over his own body, and very little memory of who he was before. He took the identity of Argus and left England, seeking aid. He asked the Cientist Council in Oasis for help, and in exchange he promised to oversee the Advanced Robotics Ministery. Nowadays he lives a recluse, a hermit in Oasis, crafting the worlds most advanced defense systems and dealing with his life as a dual entity.Abilities:Passive: Overshield.

It's like comparing a heap of garbage to just a regular bag of garbage.Old Bastion had no survivability and no use. Recon mode was awful and sentry mode was also awful. Bastion never had a chance to heal because they would die too quickly before finding a spot to heal. The only thing objectively better about Bastion was their ultimate and their capability to kill close-ranged DPS.Current Bastion can actually attempt escapes now with faster transformations and healing on the go. Recon mode doesn't feel like Soldier 76 in a wheelchair and turret form is still capable of tearing through tanks and destroying barriers. Their ultimate is slightly worse, but it was already pretty bad to begin with.

"244","I don't believe people understand the severity of the issue. Please Watchhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kDqZ_dsZAQ________Recently purchased a amazing new Ultrawide monitor however I've since learned that Overwatch does not support true 21:9 aspect ratio and instead crops the game to fit which actually ends up showing less than normal 16:9. Apparently Blizzard says it would be unfair and thus has implemented this janky version instead. Why are you crippling Ultrawide users by showing them less than 16:9 I'm baffled. I'm here to beg Blizzard to please reconsider. The real argument at hand here is if Blizzard is concerned about competitive play then why is no one discussing the other things that also give advantages like console users being able to play with mouse and keyboard or people with better internet giving them lower latency or monitor refresh rates giving better accuracy and smoothness. Why is that the people who have decided to upgrade their hardware to Ultrawides must chose whether or not to play with black bars or this severely cropped version. I find it rather baffling that every major title that has been release in the last 10 years has support for true 21:9 resolutions including other competitive shooters and mobas like CS:GO or HOTS yet somehow it's not okay in Overwatch. What makes Overwatch different from other competitive shooters that 21:9 is not okay here but okay everywhere else? What about Destiny 2 that just came out, I've been playing it and it looks amazing because it supports the real aspect ratio and is not cropped; even the pre-rendered cutscenes are in true 21:9 which I commend Bungie for because even games like Witcher3 give black boarders during cutscenes. The reality is that casuals players like myself simply just want to play the game and have fun and basically telling us that our hardware is unfair is silly. We aren't going to competitive offline tournaments where 16:9 is the standard so what is the big deal here? No one wants to play with black bars on their screen when every other game in the world including all other competitive shooters support real 21:9. Forget CS:GO, what about Gears, CoD, BattleField, Destiny2 all competitive shooters supporting 21:9. Overwatch is a freaking casual game, just let people enjoy themselves. Like others have pointed out in this thread how often would any of you people against 21:9 even run into players like me with Ultrawides when only 1% users even own one.Can we please get an update on this or will Blizz stay forever silent on this issue?",0.435897435897436,"FALSE"

It's used more to prevent enemies to get on the objective.When you get killed, stunned, hooked or sleep-darted, now the ultimate doesn't refundMinor problems:Icicles:They are the only projectiles affected by damage decayThe minimum damage they can do is 22 (because of the damage decay), and compared to other heroes, this is not really muchIce wall:Allies can't see where are you going to place the wall, and this can make them frustrated easily, and this favors the trolling(These are some ways proposed by me and other players to make her more viable)Buff suggestions:Frost stream:Now it decreases the effect of ""special movement"" abilities (like double jumps, run, and similar abilities), initial debuff effect from 10% that increases up to 25%Now affects vertical movements tooFrozen shields will take (20%) more damageSpeed has been increased to 30 m/sThis adjustment will make her primary mechanic more effective, punishes players that tries to engage Mei closely and makes her able to give teammates an occasion to destroy a shield.Cryofreeze:Now automatically reloads her weapon similar to Wraith FormAna and Moira's orbs now can heal Mei in cryofreezeNow Mei will be ready to fight again, and will be able to be healed by other healers. Blizzard:When you are killed, stunned, sleep-darted or hooked, Snowball (the drone) continues to go as a grenade and get activatedIt decreases enemies's movement abilities effect as the primary fire, but up to 45% this timeThe cast time should be reduced/removed. Mei can lose the ultimate when the drone is in her hand and not while it's out of her hand and it's going to landNow the ultimate can be used as an area denial and crowd control tool. It will punish poor enemy positioning more often, and will reward players that can escapeIciclesThe damage falloff should be reduced (minimum range or damage increased)Ice wallNow allied can see the aura of where the wall will be spawned (proposed by XodiaK)It's slippery for enemies: if a Genji tries to climb it, a Widowmaker tries to grapple or a Lucio tries to wallride on it, they will fall. This will make rage less the teammates because they will know where the wall will be (useful also for players without a microphone). Probably this will discourage the trolling. Also will make it a better defense tool.Netcode/latenciesWhen Mei enters in cryofreeze it actives without the possibility to be hooked/stunned/killed and she starts to heal herselfWhen the wall spawns bullets can't trepass itThis will make Mei more viable and less frustrating to play, with these issues fixed and with a better netcodeBug and issues:Check the Reddit threads i linked, there are listed all Mei bugs with proofsTL;DRMei at the moment she's inefficient compared to other heroesShe needs bug fixes,QoL fixes/adjustments and few buffsA lot of heroes can escape her freeze ray and her ultimate.She got a lot of unfixed bugs(Sorry for the wall of text.)",-0.189873417721519,"TRUE"

"300","Hello Activision Blizzard. I would like to write to you today to discuss the current state of Junkrat's ability commonly referred to as ""RIP-Tire."" This ability is regarded as one of the most unbalanced and not fun abilities to play against. There are several reasons for this. One being that the tire moves incredibily quickly and can turn on a dime. This makes it basically luck to hit with projectiles and extremely hard to hit with hitscan, even among the top level. Also, junkrat builds his tire extremely quickly, which is not good for an ability which is considered overpowered or good. For example, Zarya's ultimate ability known as ""Graviton Surge,"" builds slowly because of how powerful it is. Lastly, an issue not brought up often but is very important in my personal opinion is that tire can ride along roofs. This is very broken because the tire can LOS(Line of Sight) the players and gives it plenty of cover. In addition, when it rides along the roof, it is silent and you do not hear the engine of the tire like you would when it is riding along the ground.

"351","(reserving this post to edit in other suggestions from the community, not the point of this thread, but here to voice any suggestions)FIRST OFF: I want to caution that reworking ideas are not the point behind this thread. More than anything it's to shed light on the issues that Symmetra is facing and how she's becoming obsolete with the evolving nature of the game. These ideas are the kind of ideas Symmetra players wonder about when they think of ""viability"" in the sense that other characters have that fall under the category of support, without boxing her into something as arbitrary as a healer. I've tried to limit the amount of ""reworking"" suggestions in this thread, but at this point, I'm leaning more towards it due to her place in the evolving nature of the game and competitive team comps. If you have an idea you feel is within her playstyle and will bring her viability, please list it in this forum. Ideas that have been thrown out:(Kyleesie Ideas)New Features to Existing Abilities:Photon BarrierChange the shape of the barrier into a sphere so it can block damage from all angles, and fully protect someone running with it.Health readuced to 900 down from 1025.- OR -Provides 75 shields to any ally it comes into contact with. The shields decay slowly 3 seconds after leaving a 5 meter radius of the Turret projecting the barrierReddit Idea:Let her place supportive turrets.(The issue with this is it’s not as flexible as other support utility and is too area based. Which in the end would cause the same potential problems as before)My idea:Her Glove as a Secondary weapon, similar to torb and mercy, unlocks a new ability under the primary fire of this ""weapon"": Photon Shield (yes, bring it back)Channeled ability, resource meter of 12-15 seconds. 30 Yard range. Grants 40 barrier health to your target per second. Can give up to 50 extra health. When not channeling, will degenerate at a rate of 5 hp per second. Barrier health is the same mechanic used in sound barrier and doomfists passive, which is why I suggest using this mechanic as a ""psuedo-heal"". This would grant her a place in the game as the only support counter available to Ana's grenade. She'll still primary play as a defensive dps, but this will give her defensive support utility that helps sustain the team and the main healer, without actually making her a healer. The way that barrier health functions, it would work somewhere between healing and the original photon shield. That is, that instead of providing a flat hp bonus, it would give a max of 50 ""bonus health"", but since it's barrier health, any missing HP would have to be filled with Symmetra's resource meter degenerating barrier health (like doomfist) before the ""bonus"" hp would apply.These suggestions, or variations of it, are the most popular on the forums. I’d even be willing to have her gun range nerfed, as lower SR seems to hate it, in exchange for more utility.Basically the same as her old ability, but not a flat hp bonus. Since it’s barrier health, missing hp has to be given before giving the bonus.Lastly, this is a quote that I really like from one of the other very well thought out Symmetra threads (Kyleesie's thread) that I really enjoyed.  This basically sums up opinion on why on why it may be necessary to give her a ""pseudo-heal""/stronger damage mitigation, while staying true to the developers vision for her. You don't need to make her a healer! That's the beauty of it. You just need to make her sustain to the point the team doesn't miss an offhealer :)Comments: I know the developers intentionally designed Sym without any traditional healing. However, while I respect their philosophy to design a unique way for her to function as a support, I strongly feel that her inability to heal (especially while classified as a ""support"" hero) negatively affects how players perceive her in the game. Simply put, Symmetra confuses people. New players are unsure of what she is used for, and veteran competitive and pro players don't value her utility over other support heroes who can actually heal. As a result, Symmetra is stifled by negative opinions, and those who choose to play her receive an egregious and unfair amount of toxicity and blame.Ideas added later based on discussions within the thread:Mohock Ideas: Letting her be stronger anti-mobility by having turrets affect things such as Dash/Blink, allowing her to set the base of her ultimate in a predetermined location before she gets it.Crestren Ideas: Allowing her to have more buildables, such as bridges, elevators, or structures that grant support to the team.Dr.Fate Idea:: Symmetra is granted a passive that gives sustain, similar to Lucio but exclusively affecting shield HP pools.",0.220338983050847,"FALSE"
"352","Here are some of my potential ideas that could improve her kit and make her more viable:Turret-Survivability:Give her turrets thermoptic camo like Sombras. The turret stays invisible until an enemy comes in reach, decloaks and shoots. After a few seconds out of combat they recloak again. This would allow for more flexible and creative traps and prevents Tracer/DVa/Reaper from shootgunsniping them across the map.Turret-Placement: Give her turrets the flying behavior like the shieldcore, but instead of getting destroyed by hitting a surface, the turret sticks to it. This would solve the immobility issue while placing them, they could be used to contest high ground more effective and they would be more viable to push a point. Bonus buff if they would start fireing midflight.Turret-Slowing: Slowing effects from the turrets (or Mei) could be applied to ""teleport""-abilities like Tracers Blink or Genjis Dash, resulting in a shortening of the traveling distance equivalent of the percentage the hero is slowed down. A 25% Movement speed reduction from one turret would lead to a 10,5m dash instead of 14m.Ultimates: Let her place the base plate of her ultimates in advance even with 0% on her ultcharge and activate them when they are ready. You would set up the base with Q and could change the placement at any time by building a new one in case you change your mind or they get destroyed. I would even disable their shields until they are activated so flankers could dispose of them quickly if discovered. Pressing Q with 100% ultcharge would bring up the same image as of now of the sg/tp and you can select to activate the existing base by looking up or build a new one by looking down towards the ground. This way, Symmetra players don't have to leave the battle for prolonged times to set up her ults at a good spot and they can be activated right as the fight breaks loose to get a better impact.",0.333333333333333,"FALSE"

People like that cant even climb to plat with her.Sym was strong because there wasn't many strong heroes back there but with recent buffs to other heroes and new heroes coming out, her kit become too weak because whenever a new patch note come out, she is passively nerfed one way or another.Even Luminum has been screaming about buffing her. Aside from Luminum, Hoshi and Stevo, no one would be able to reach their level especially Luminum as his skilled plays are incredible with limited kit. But the level of blocking all the Tracer and Rein's ult, even using turrets to block Doomfist's Rocket Punch is extremely high, if you dont main her to at least Diamond, its impossible to do it.Recently, Moira is out and with her mobility, she can outplay Sym with ease. Believe me or not, Sym will start to fall back along with Torb (really, these two dont need to have their skin designed in WC, no one gonna pick them)Sometimes i feel i could have been in Master by spending 150 hours on another char instead of sym but i love her and seeing her at the bottom of the game and being hated by most of the community is really sad.",0.111111111111111,"FALSE"

Someone posted this on another Sym thread.Posted by ImWithDerpBeen trying to think of a way to translate more of Symmetra's architectural skills into gameplay and make her more interesting to play.BTW, this idea is focused more on making Symm more fun, not necessarily more balanced. If something like this does get implemented then Symm would hopefully receive balance tweaks to make her viable without being OP.---Secondary weapon: Hard Light ConstructorPrimary fire launches an orb-like object in a straight line that sticks to the first surface it hits. Up to two of these orbs can exist at once. Like her turrets, orbs have a cooldown but can store several charges.If both orbs are placed within line of sight of each other, a hard light structure is created between them. The type of structure depends on whether the orbs are on floors/ceilings/walls.Illustration of different structure types: https://i.imgur.com/ygMBfDT.pngDetails of different structure types:Bridges stay in place, allowing allies to walk over themElevators move between both orbs, carrying any allies standing on themAllies standing above/under a Power Field gain increased damage (and/or rate of fire?)Allies who walk through a Boost Screen gain a temporary movement speed boost (and/or a temporary shield?)Secondary fire deactivates active orbs/structures.The orbs can be destroyed but have regenerating shields to protect themselves like Symm's teleporter/shield generator.I personally like it as it does fit in Sym's character. It also helps alleviate mobility to non mobile heroes (like Ana, Zen, Mei) so she can play a role in that and help her team move around better. And it does fit as it provides another utility to help support her team as shes not a healer type, she supports her team with her utility.",0.636363636363636,"FALSE"
"355","I've played Sym for over 200 hours and she's carried me from about 1700 to about 60 points away from Diamond. One suggestion I've had for a while is to add a simple 1HP barrier to her turrets, as a barrier will always absorb the impact from blow no matter how much it does. This would prevent them from being destroyed by something like D.Va's ult, Rein charge, Genji's Swift Strike, Lucio's Boop, Junkrat's Concussion Mine, etc. It gives Symmetra more staying power because there are less ways to counter her turrets, which are her main mode of support, but they still only effectively have 2HP so any automatic weapon fire can still dispose of them quickly.Another is that Symmetra just needs to take less time to do things across the board. She takes too long to deploy turrets, which then also have to activate so around 2 seconds from deployment to activation time for a turret which makes her harder to use on attack since she needs so much setup time. Her photon barrier needs to deploy earlier in the animation and closer to Symmetra, there are so many times where I have perfectly timed a block only to have the Hook/Flashbang/Widow Headshot go through it and then the barrier floats away from my corpse.I also think an interesting buff would be to either have her alt fire charge faster or move faster. She has the only basic attack that goes through barriers at range and, while useful in its current state, can sum up to poke damage if they have two healers. I think allowing it to either move or charge faster would give Symmetra a better chance on attack as she would be able to deal massive, unforgiving amounts of damage to the enemy team. These are mostly just QoL suggestions, as far as I'm concerned. The only straight buff is the charge or movement speed, and I think that's pretty minor tbh. The only serious kit alteration I could think would be to re-add back the photon shield at 25 and let her stack that with her shield generator, with the caveat that the 25 shields disappear if she dies. That would allow Symmetra to have a somewhat better impact before she's able to get an ultimate up, but can be punished if she were to die.",0.04,"FALSE"

My issue with Symmetra is that her supportive potential is near non-existent if your team has no awareness. I included some of Luminums gameplay in my post to illustrate this. He was doing a phenomenal job attempting to support his team, but they weren't taking his openings and not letting him support. In turn, it was like he didn't do anything, even though he was working extra hard with his limited kit.Imagine if an entire character's kit was similar to Zarya's grav in the sense that it needs friendly follow up to actually do anything?

"364","This is extremely long, but I want to illustrate Symmetras problems and how to fix them, hopefully to enlighten the devs on how to fix her. There's not really a TLDR, but if you want to get the gist of it, skim through the bolded areas.Hi Guys. I’ve been hesitant to post this thread, and instead wanted to wait until after Blizzcon to do so. There’s been a huge surge of concern over Symmetra’s place in the game, so much so that there are 3 Megathreads (all from people in masters, with obvious game sense) on making her more supportive in the general forum, and a reddit thread with 3000+ upvotes. https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759249296?page=1https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20758668065?page=1https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759257002?page=1https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759220930?page=1https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/7afy3b/the_change_for_symmetra_we_didnt_know_we_needed/?utm_term=b41127a9-d761-42ca-93eb-d750b12c3337&amp;utm_medium=search&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=Overwatch&amp;utm_content=1After hearing the recent Q&amp;A regarding Symmetra, it’s kind of clear that the developers are somewhat unsure of her place in the game, and so I’m hoping that this thread will concisely summarize her issues as well as give the developers clear knowledge of how to fix her, rather than recategorizing her. Blizzcon Q&amp;A:Any plans to make Symmetra more viable in competitive? Maybe healing abilities?Symmetra doesn't really fit well in the support category, but doesn't fit in defense either. In the future we might need to revist the categories to better accomodate changes with the game.Symmetra doesn't see much play in high competitive, but her recent toolkit change brought some interesting changes that made her more viable.Please, please, developers. It’s obvious you listen to us, otherwise a Talon Healer wouldn’t have been the next hero despite the massive demand for her. The community obviously wants her to be more supportive. Recategorizing her will not fix her fundamental issues when there are currently better, more intuitive options in the game for her niche (junkrat), as well as more supportive options for her niche coming as well (moira).From the Patch concerning her rework:""We wanted to address two main issues with Symmetra. First, on the whole, we felt that she didn’t feel active enough. Second, due to the nature of her Teleporter, she felt weak in certain situations on different maps and game modesTo address the first point, we replaced her more passive Photon Shield ability with a much more active ability: Photon Barrier. Now, Symmetra can help lead the charge on offense or help shut down a big push on defense by actively blocking damage for your team. For the second point, we noticed players would often switch off of Symmetra once they found themselves in a situation where her Teleporter wasn’t as useful. For example, when playing her on defense on an Assault map, players often used her to defend the first capture point, then quickly switched to another hero if that point fell. To help her feel more useful in more situations, we've given her an alternative to her Teleporter. The Shield Generator is just as important for the enemy to deal with, but is useful in more situations. .""This is important to note, as she is the most passive support out of all 5, and she is also the most situational. She is not viable on attack, as the intention of the rework. The first rework failed its intended purpose.You can read through this or skim to the bolded sections. While a lot of people argue that Symmetra is strong within her niche. That is precisely the issue with her. When she was most viable was within her Niche on chokes such as Hanamura, Eichenwalde, and Volksaya defense. There were numerous complaints on how hard chokes were to break through, so developers made several balancing adjustments, both to the maps, and characters who had either abilities or mobility to deal with the chokes. From that point onwards,  new map development gave a lot of alternative pathways and elevation that lessened her Niche's effectiveness and gave numerous easy options for counterplay, not to mention she’s not very viable outside of her niche, either.The point? The newest maps, newest characters, and newest buffs to heroes mean that her original Niche is shrinking, and her viability outside that niche is dismal if not compromising to the team. AKA: She’s not relevant to the current version of the game.The elephant in the room: She is the utility support, however, she is the only support whose utility mechanics are not readily available for use (speed, discord, damage boost) while the other support who has utility on cooldown has two highly active, flexible utility abilities that have a variety of uses that outclass Photon Barrier, and have less counters than her turrets do.  The other issue is that all of these support alternatives not only have better utility in their actual kit (not taking into account ultimates), but all the other support utility is in conjunction to healing. She was designed as a damage mitigating, utility support, that defends the backlines; however, almost all of the support in her kit comes from her ultimate, which makes her the only character who is balanced entirely around the merit of her ultimate- which is one of her design flaws, if this patch from Blizzard is any indication:Game-changing ultimate abilities were coming up a bit too frequently. This change helps keep them in check while still allowing them to be powerful. (universal nerf to ultimate charge)If a character is balanced around an ultimate, then it is likely that their kit is lacking. Symmetra has the lowest ultimate costs in the game, and can keep her ultimate up indefinitely. This should raise concerns as to what part of her kit makes this necessary in her design. They wanted her to more engaging in the rework, with more of a capacity for proactive and reactive engagement, but her kit has most of the most passive abilities in the game. Also important to note, if all of her her supportive merit is funneled into her destructible ultimates, she will always lose to Zen/Lucio, who don’t need their ultimate or to keep a structure alive to be supportive. Not only that, but her supportive capacity was originally her E, which rightly means that her original design did not involve a passive ultimate to provide support.Please, complete her kit. We know this is something you’re capable of doing. Within the last month, you completed Mercy’s kit due to the feedback of DPS mains. This is feedback from the people who play the character. Please fix her.She doesn’t  NEED  to heal, but she suffers from an incomplete kit as a support character. (if you need proof she's a support) Luminums videos show her potential as a support, but watching his videos often makes it clear to me that her kit is just not as cohesive as the other characters in the game, even the defense characters which skeptics seem to be convinced she is. His best plays are supportive plays, so she obviously has potential as a support. She just plays more like an offensive support, similar to Zen.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1GvmBQk8-shttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flWwBFCTjsUhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBbe7ylCy18(this was patched but shows how he needs high game sense, and to be innovative to a crazy level to succeed with her limited kit) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sJwuH1BMwY(this video shows the potential of team flanks at 4:10) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YhsywtY2OM(and this video shows why symmetra falls short as a support… she needs her team to support her for her to support them. She’s more follow-through dependent than any other support because she lacks support in her actual kit, but people will troll you because they see you as a “troll pick”) He makes great plays, saving his team from reinhardt ultimates, making team flanks, etc. But really, while that’s amazing, there’s not much he can do inbetween that except try to make picks. While other offsupports like lucio/zen, have their utility up (speed/discord) in addition to no cooldown, no ultimate options for heals (heal aura/harmony orb).Quality of Life adjustments for Symmetra are necessary, but if that is all she receives, she likely won't have a place in the game as the game evolves.The best, and most commonly suggested Quality of Life suggestions are:Turrets: Reduce the delay in placing and ""activating"" the turrets after you deploy them, as well as remove the slow that Symmetra is afflicted with when placing them.Ultimates: Let them be seen through walls for teammates, as well as willful deconstruction of her barrier generator so a skilled Symmetra can change her nesting location, similarly to how a widowmaker will change her sniping location. Let her deconstruct her teleporter to redeem some of her ult charge if the charges are running low. Also, allow her to build her ultimates on walls and ceilings at slightly longer range, so her setups become less predictable.(via AConstelle) Remove the 5-6 second delay she has on gaining ult when her Shield Generator is destroyed. The delay isn't there for TP, but it is for Shield Gen for some reason, and 6 seconds is a lot of time for Sym. Also the blue line indicating the Shield Gen's radius would be swell.Photon Barrier: There have been numerous suggestions for this ability. Increase the charges on it, decrease the cooldown, give her more control over it. The biggest consistent complaint I've seen with this ability is the fact that Symmetra has a harder time contributing with this support utility than other supports have contributing with their utility that is often on a lower cooldown or does not have a cooldown while simultaneously being easier skills to contribute with. This ability needs to be able to compete with an offhealing slot, period. It’s her only active support ability. The other point I want to bring up is that she is the only support who has a viable alternative to rez, which a lot of people are concerned about.[Moderator edit - I removed the direct call-out to the Dev team.

Considering how long we on Console have been effectively shafted though, this was the best option I could think of.[Warning: Wall of text incoming.]If it was planned, from day one, to release the game on both PC and Console, then why are the concerns of the Console player base not being addressed, or at the very least, acknowledged? We had no choice but to buy the game for $60 (we didn't have an option of being able to buy the game for just $40 like PC does). This means that we are having to spend more just to be able to even get the game to begin with.Furthermore, we not only had to wait 15 months for a report system, but said system is super abusable. If you guys on PC think that the report system and automated bans is rough, allow me to enlighten you: it's even WORSE on Console. If we file a ticket with Blizzard as a result of a ban in-game on Console, we will be told that the Consoles have separate systems that Blizzard can't access, and will thus be told to file a ticket with Microsoft/Sony. If we file a ticket with Microsoft/Sony, they state that they don't handle in-game bans, only gamer-tag bans. This means that neither party knows anything with regards to Console in-game bans. Why are we being told to file a ticket with Microsoft or Sony, even though they've already stated that they do NOT handle in-game bans? Something has to be known from this so we can at least HAVE a chance to be able to appeal our in-game bans. Proof: https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759446940 Thread made by someone who plays on Console who has had to deal with this very thingThen, there's the 30+ things that we on Console lack (some of which are already on the PC version), and the extreme most part of those things which can quite easily be implemented. If all feedback is welcome, then why is our feedback not being addressed, much less acknowledged? Why are threads asking about when new cosmetics are coming being addressed, but not our consolidated feedback thread with regards to Console issues? A thread by the way, that has been going strong for over 4 months and counting. If elaboration on this is further needed, then I direct you to this thread here: https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20758447090?page=1EDIT (this was added on 12-19-17): Heck, there's not even an end-game for us. Competitive for us on Console really does not mean jack simply because there is no end-game. There's no OWL, Contenders, Open Division, heck; there's not even a single tournament that we on Console can even get that's hosted, much less sponsored, by Blizzard. Before anyone mentions it, yes I get that Blizzard has always been more of a PC developer than a Console one. However, they released the game on all platforms, and even had planned to do so from the very beginning. Therefore, this same care that Blizzard gives to PC, needs to be given to Console as well. Say someone on our platform reaches Top 500 and really wants to play in things like Open Division; what would happen? Would that person be forced to move over to PC just to have a chance? Simple little standard things like this really press home the second class citizen vibe that we console players receive. With all this said, can we at least get an update on when our current issues will be addressed please? We don't want our player-base to fade away completely because our feedback is not being listened to.

"373","I think the balance of some heroes seem kinda broken on the console. This is starting to feel kinda unfair and annoying. Junkrat: he became a little too OP with all the buffs. Before the buffs he was already a viable option in the matches. Probably not the best in some situations, but he was already an option. It's harder to eliminate his ult on the consoles than on the PC, and nowadays, it just feels that the only possible counter to a junkrat is another junkrat. A better junkrat. The problem is mainly this spamming damage of his, not even his ultimate. I personally feel that his ult is in a ok place. But it feels so unfair to be killed by spam bombs when the junkrat is not even aiming at you. Again, the aim on the consoles is not as precise as it is on the PC. and with the two mines and bombs after dying, i just feel like all the junkrats just spam damage and go forward. even if they die, they still may kill someone. it just feels like not a lot of skill is needed when it comes to playing with junkrat. It doesnt really feels fair to be killed by someone who's ot even looking at the fight, just spamming bombs behind a wall.Ana, however, she is just on the opposite place. The nerf on the healing was i guess pretty unnecessary on the consoles. On the PC, i guess it was ok. But it's so much harder to be a good healer as ana on consoles, again, the aim is not as precise, and she is far from being a viable option, comparing her to the other healers. She doesnt have the same pick rate, sometimes u see some people picking her, but it feels, that as a healer, she doesnt really has the same value as the others.

With that time, maybe you can work to afford yourself some more video games?[Warning: Wall of text incoming.]Keep in mind: I didn't make this thread to hear PC Elitists mock us (I'm not looking at the 'hur dur PC Master Race' posts here (you know what I'm implying); I'm looking at those posts that relate to ""Buy a PC you Console Peasant/2nd class citizen"", etc.). I made this thread to let our voices with regards to our platform of the game be heard.Consoles have more convenience in them, and the vast majority of us have friends that play on Console, not on PC. We're not blind in this community. Look at threads that get a reply from devs in this forum (not to be confused with mods here). How many of those threads are PC related, and something small (i.e. when new cosmetics are coming)? Sure, it's not many, but it still has the better reply chance. Now look at the other end: the threads that are Console related, and something well researched/documented. How many of these kinds of threads get a reply from devs? Practically none.To answer your last bit: yes I already do have a job. The reason why I don't go and buy more games is because:1. It's made by a company who is known to have greedy business practices (I'm looking at you EA, main Activision (so as not to be confused with Blizzard Entertainment), and Ubisoft, to name a few). 2. Overwatch is still better than quite a lot of games that were made even this year (even despite what it lacks on Console). If I come off as somebody who sounds easily tilted, that may very much be the case (I won't deny it). However, not only did we still pay for the game, but a good chunk of the things that we've been wanting/needing, we've been asking since launch (that's almost 19 months ago now). We still are as passionate as you guys on PC are about this game. We aren't even asking for a lot with threads like this one, and Biv's (linked in OP), to name a couple. We don't even get something as simple as ""Hey guys, we hear you loud and clear!"" on these forums, even despite all of our concerns. Yet, there's threads that ask when new cosmetics are coming that get answered within a few hours, and in some cases, even as little as 15 minutes. Look at how long we had to wait for our Report System (and this is just to name one example). We didn't even get a reply about when our Report System would be coming until 8 months after the game launched (this was when they hoped to have it in during, or even before summer, you see). When we had asked for an update in July, we get the response of ""Soon™"" (again, you know what I'm implying). Now you have 14 months past launch and it's still not in the Console version of the game. The Report Feature was not enabled for us until the 1.14 patch, which released on August 28th. That's 15 months gone that we've had to deal with being unable to report glitchers, throwers, etc.. I'm not going to so much use the term cheaters in this bit; a vast majority of the cheating that had occurred on Console were people glitching into walls to be able to prevent point caps making it impossible for the attacking team to cap their objective. So we had people that could get away with literally anything and everything and we wouldn't be able to do anything about it.You also can't justify the excuse of ""It's because of Sony/Microsoft"" either. Games that have been available on Console have already had a Report System available on day 1. Heck, Fortnite is still in beta, and it already has a Report System. Hope I've cleared up some of our situation to you. Apologies if I've sounded critical on some parts. As I stated though, we are still passionate about this game just as much as you guys are.What are you not getting?!?I was not talking to you. My post was to someone else.

Lies.You're also biasing the PoTG system even further towards DPS with your multikill angle. It's an even dumber system than what we already have in place. I swear to god I saw many times Mercy randomly healing 2 people on the objective after a tean fight though they didn't lose so much of their hp. Also, I saw a Hanzo potg with no single hit or any damage done, but when it comes up to me sending a DVa bomb into the enemy team and killing four people, the potg is just a bastard torb killing 2 already weakended guys on my team. You also need to take in mind that the game's automatic systems are very !@#$ and broken so they allow a healing Mercy get potg instead of multikills.",-0.2,"TRUE"

I got it once for killing Genji during ult...Healers generally do poorly with POTG - Since the Mercy rework I've hardly seen her get it at all, Ana NEVER gets it, Lucio might if he boops 2/3 people off a cliff and I'm really not sure what the requisites are for Zen getting it - every time I've had it for him it's...not been that impressiveAdding to that - Sombra and Orisa who are both geared towards support also rarely get it.",-0.142857142857143,"TRUE"

(my personal big issue with this)*Possible solution to this-pause respawn timer/prevent it from going out while Mercy is resurrecting target player-reset Mercy's resurrect if target player respawns before resurrect takes effect2) The non-reset to GA when ulting is dandy.

"548","Sorry to tell you but all of you are wrong and it's OP's mistake due to poor reasoning and writing. I'll explain you what's going on with this matter, why it is stupid to be implemented and what it is in first place.Bunny hop has nothing to do with a mere spam space. It was essentially a glitch in counter strike where the character's velocity was increasing if you were strafe jumping in certain patterns. Strafe jumping can be observed with soldier, while sprinting and lucio. However, if you were pressing space again in a specific momentum, your character wasn't losing his velocity, which had as a result to increase continuously your speed. As the speed increases, it becomes more difficult to control your momentum in both strafes and jumps, so eventually you fail. That was bunny hop.It was forbidden to be used in tournaments for long time, since it messed around with the engagement timings. In short there was a high distortion in time (you didn't know when an enemy 1 mile away will eventually come to you). After many years, they decided to allow bunny hopping as it became a common practice in unofficial games and tournaments, but they forbidden the use of mouse scroll as jump.Except acceleration and time distortion, there was another use of bunny hop. They used to bunny hop to entry and become more difficult targets to snipers. However, there's a huge difference here. In Counter Strike there was different dmg if you hit an arm, a leg or body. Snipers there have only 1 bullet at the time, and they one shot body and head, while you will not be killed if you are hit on the leg. This does not occur in Overwatch. Furthermore, overwatch heroes can aim while in the air, while counter strike characters are penalized. Therefore, bunnyhopping there, gives you high mobility with the drawback of not being able to hit.It's not easy to hit someone who bunny hops properly, even for a master... However who cares about ""hitting properly"" in overwatch? Just smash his legs and he takes the same dmg. Also, there's no such a thing as predictable bunnyhopping because velocity increases, but not linearly. It depends on the strafe at the given jump.",-0.692307692307692,"TRUE"

"569","I don't think Junkrat is OP. I'll try to play devils advocate though.Posted by DarkCat1.- Junkrat counters bad coordination easily, if your team keeps going in the exact same place Junkrat is spamming your team is just gonna receive severe dmg if not die.I don't understand how that's saying he's not OP? That's just a feature of the character. ""Genji isn't OP, because he picks off people from behind enemy lines because of his quick mobility""The problem, as I understand it, isn't that he has area denial. It's that he can deny multiple areas at once through grenades, mines, and trap. Posted by DarkCat2.- If junkrat jumps on your tank and kill it, its entirely your teams fault for not killing him, he puts himself at high risk and you guys just ignore him leading to the dead of your tank.""He isn't OP because you guys didn't shoot him!""That's not an argument? You're just saying that because he did something risky, he isn't OP just because it worked out. You're technically right on that, but if Junkrat can jump onto a tank and then kill the tank before the tank can kill him or the other team can kill him, that's a problem. Since Junkrat can deal (at most) 460 damge in one second (assuming there are two mines thrown, the enemy is trapped, and he hits with one grenade), it's reasonable to say that's a little ridiculous.Posted by DarkCat3.- Self dmg was removed because it was a huge drawback to him, Junkrat is suppose to dominate at close range and having the self dmg didnt allow that, people actually (Especially tanks) used to just walk towards him to make himself receive dmg and then just kill him easily. Yeah self damage is to make sure you can't just run in and guarantee you do 120 damage every single shot. Having a guaranteed 120 DPS is ridiculous, frankly. Self damage existed so that explosion based characters would have to keep their range, meaning that you could theoretically kill them with a well timed shield or body block. Posted by DarkCatThe Pharah comparison doesnt make sense if you are at range to dmg yourself has Pharah is your fault.A comparison to Pharah is valid. If you're saying the reason Junkrat would die to self damage was because people would rush him, then that also applies to Pharah. People can rush Pharah down and make her kill herself on self damage. Range is irrelevant, we're talking about rushing someone down.Posted by DarkCat4.- If you wanna kill him DONT fight him at close range always keep your distance, at long range he basically cant dmg you, at medium range you just have to evade his nades and the mine since is slow is pretty inefficient at medium range. (i win against him most of the time thanks to this)In a strictly 1v1 scenario, sure. That'd work. But, in a team game, if your team is working together you won't be able to get that sightline on Junkrat because his team will take you out. You're not wrong, technically, but it's a moot point because it isn't a 1v1 situation.Posted by DarkCat5.- Junkrat CANT one-shot without his Rip-Tire or the help of Zen or Mercy (And even with their help he can only oneshot Tracer and D.va unless both are helping him)No one can one-shot unless it's Hanzo or Widow. That's a moot point.And he can effectively oneshot any hero below 340 HP (trap + 2 mines). Think the hook combo, while that wasn't technically a oneshot, it sure felt one.Posted by DarkCat6.- The double mine thing... he is wasting his mines if he killed you using both, he just used his tools to escape making him an easy kill.It won't matter if he has no escape after he's killed you, because in this scenario, it's a 1v1. If he's in the middle of your team, then his Total Mayhem means that he's still denying an area even though he died. There isn't a negative to that scenario. He either gets a pick and gets away, or he trades and denies area. No downside.Posted by DarkCat7.- Im sure someone if gonna come up with this, Junkrat was trash before his buffs i keep hearing people saying that he shouldnt had got any buff.

"582","This is a post I made in an another thread about his pickrate/winrate. I'll just c/p it here since it's relevantJunkrat start with 7.76% pickrate and go dow to 3.29% in GM, where his winrate goes to  47.42% to 57.76% in GMSymmetra starts with 2.05% pickrate and goes down to 0.86% in GM, where her winrate stays consistently at the average 59%, except on bronze, which is 56%,and as equal, torbjorn goes to 1.73% to 0.51% , and 52.96% to 56%, an average across all the ranks.Tracer goes from 2.45% to 7,76%  pickrate and 43.67% to 54.46% winrate, and almost the same ocurrs with genji, which goes from 3.00% to 6.54% and a winrate of 44.91% to 54.33%.With this stats, i can see Symmetra, Torbjorn and Junkrat Pickrates decay, but their winrates go up, where Tracer and Genji go to the Oposite. both pickrates and winrates go up. But why? The explanation goes into my mind is that the more up you go the ladder, the best you deal with the heroes with Decaying pickrate (Junk, Symmetra, Torbjorn), and the only ones remaining is the One Trick/ Mains of those heroes. Yet the GM/Master rank is filled with good Hitscan/Mobility heroes, with can be more effective overall.Yet i still fail to see in which point those heroes with a Higher Winrate and Low Pickrate are OP across all the ranks. if he is op, why his pickrate is decaying?The GM's and Masters fail to see how that hero is OP and choose to pick a weaker one?Thanks for proving that you don't understand what ""skewed winrate"" means. Torbjorn and Symmetra have skewed winrates because they are usually picked on 1st point of 2CP and Hybrid maps. Meaning, if the game results in a hold, they will both get credited with a full victory because during the entire defense round, they played that hero. However, if the hold is not succesful, people will usually swap from those heroes. And if the game is lost in the end, they will only get a 50% of the loss or 33% of the loss, depending on whether it's 2 CP or Hybrid.That's why they have unusually high winrates and very low pickrates. Same thing applies to their pickrate. For example, Torbjorn has a 0.65% pickrate in Platinum. That means that you would only see a Torb once in every 13 games. Which clearly isn't the case. Symmetra has 0.88% pickrate. Which means that you would see her once every ~10 games. Which also clearly isn't the case. That's why those are skewed. And as for the rest of your argument, it's normal that a characters winrate goes up as rank increases. Why? Because people in rank X don't play only versus rank X people. They also play versus people ranked higher than them and people ranked lower than them. To make an extreme example:Players in bronze play versus players in bronze but they also play versus players in silver. And generally, they will lose more to players in silver than they will win against them.Other end of it is grandmaster. GM plays against GM but they also play against Masters and sometimes even Diamond. And they will generally win versus diamonds more than diamonds will win against them. So you won't get much information looking at the pure winrate in some rank alone. But if you take a look at what happens with the winrate of the hero in a rank in relation to other heroes in the rank, that is a better indicator.Junkrat has the 2nd highest winrate and the highest pickrate out of all DPS characters in Bronze. Bastion has the highest winrate but Bastion also has 5 times smaller pickrate.Junkrat has the highest winrate and the highest pickrate out of all DPS characters in Silver. Junkrat has the highest winrate and the highest pickrate out of all DPS characters in Gold. Junkrat has the highest winrate and the 4th highest pickrate out of all DPS characters in Platinum. His pickrate is the 4th highest but they are all close (McCree 5.15%, Genji - 4.94%, 76 - 4.67%, Junkrat 4.52%)Junkrat has the highest winrate and the 6th highest pickrate out of all DPS characters in Diamond. Most picked is Genji with almost 6%. Junkrat has 3.86% pickrateJunkrat has the highest winrate and the 5th highest pickrate out of all DPS characters in Masters. Most picked is Genji with 6.32%. Junkrat has 3.54% pickrateJunkrat has the highest winrate and the 5th highest pickrate out of all DPS characters in Grandmaster. Most picked is Tracer with 7.76%. Junkrat has 3.29% pickrate.So, in essence, you see that even in GM, he still sees stable usage. 3.3% pickrate roughly translates to having a Junkrat on one of the teams that won't switch for the entire duration of the game in 2 out of 5 games. In every rank, he consistently stays at top of DPS characters with a very stable pickrate.For example, you take Pharah, which is a problem in some ranks for some people. She is the 2nd highest winrate DPS character in gold, platinum, diamond. Already in masters she loses a spot and drops to 3rd place and 76 takes her place. In GM she drops to 7th place in terms of winrate out of DPS characters. Why? Because hitscan skill drastically increases as you climb the ranks and she becomes very hard to play. Same thing with Tracer. Tracer has a negative winrate until diamond and masters where she is barely positive with 50.5% and on the bottom of the list of DPS characters. But then, in GM, she suddenly goes to 54.46%, putting her in the 4th place after Junkrat, Doomfist and 76. And that also makes sense. She's hard to get consistent value out of unless you're really good at tracking and have superior game sense (needed for every character but especially for her). In literally every other rank, you're better of playing 76 than Tracer. And that makes sense. But the fact that Junkrat is still up there even in GM suggests serious balance issues.

"589","Posted by saltycoffeeTry moving out of the way of his projectiles if he tries to shoot you. If he's at range, you can see them with plenty of time to move, and if he's not in any danger then he's either behind a shield or he can't see what he's shooting at.You also pointed out the relevance of the comparison yourself by noting that they are both characters that prey on others mistakes.Besides, I chose Sym as an example because you were complaining about trap being annoying. My solution? If you know they have a Junkrat, check for traps. Either destroy them or pick another route. You know, the same way that if you know they have a Sym you don't just casually stroll through a choke point... you either destroy the turrets or you pick another route...If Junkrat is firing at you in a way that simply moving aside will dodge the projectile, he's not doing it right. If the projectiles land at your feet, you need to clear the blast zone, and with more bombs coming in at a very high pace (Unlike with Symmetra's RMB), your movement space is going to be very limited, which makes you vulnerable to getting picked off or dying because you tripped over a bomb that's been lying there for five seconds.Apart from the fact that some maps don't really give you a choice outside of going through the chokepoint (Eichenwalde, Hanamura, Volskaya), in Symmetra's case you do actually kind of just flat-out walk through the chokepoint. Carwashes are immensely inefficient defense strategies, they take forever to set up and are brought down in about .2 seconds with hard counters, and 2 seconds with anyone else. Symmetra preys on enemy mistakes in terms of her own positioning, and her ultimate. She punishes enemies who are thoroughly unaware of their surroundings and allow her to sneak up on them from behind, and she punishes enemies who do not hunt down her ultimate. Junkrat punishes people who play on the objective, because he doesn't -need- to see his targets, everything he has is excessive damage in AoE format. The general direction of the target is enough for him, much like it is enough for a Hanzo ult. ""Just pick a different chokepoint!"" also works against Symmetra much more than against Junkrat, because turning your camera takes less time than setting up a whole new car wash.",-0.555555555555556,"TRUE"

She also has her sleep dart, decent damage, and her grenade if it's a tight spot.This suggestion is to help her sustain, which is sorely limited. Not just compared to other supports, but compared to other heroes. Other heroes have abilities or ways to heal themselves, many of them can afford to leave the team for a few seconds to grab a health kit, and all of them almost always have a support watching their backs.

Not enough to make her immune or anything, but enough to grant her sustain to hang around without being a 10hp target for flankers or needing to abandon the team to find a health pack.

"655","Before people freak out on me because torb is wrecks in their elo realize that Torbs performance decreases hugely the higher rank you go. Plus these buffs are targeted more towards higher on the ladder anyway. So I’m sure minor nerfs could come with a change, but this thread is for buffs. 1. ReloadTorbs reload is painfully slow it is the third slowest reload in the game (I think) yet can be gone through pretty quickly. I would suggest lowering the reload from 2 secs to 1.5. It isn’t a super big buff, but it would get rid of that frustration. Secondly, his ult should have even quicker reload or unlimited ammo. Nothing is worse than you just shredding through your clip with increased firing speed, but having to take a 2 sec break in the middle.2. Head HitboxHis head hitbox is way to large. It’s literally like a watermelon. He just absolutely gets destroyed by mcrees, hanzos, and soldiers. Not to mention his head hitbox takes up a lot of his torso leading to body shots being crits. We need to lower the hitbox so it actually covers his head and then we’ll be good.3. Unhack Yes, Sombra is underpowered and needs a buff. At the same time though when a Sombra emps to push in I want to immediately core when I’m unhacked so I could potentially stop the push. But you can’t, for whatever reason it takes longer to unhack than you. Just why? It doesn’t make sense.4. Pack to upgrade This one is definitely the most buffiest of all them, but it is aimed at attack torb. People ask me what would make attack torb viable by the average Joe. I tell them nothing will, but this would help. Right now amour pack serves one purpose, to give armour (it’s kinda in the title lol), but I think it could serve another purpose. Throwing an armour pack on a lvl 1 turret instantly upgrades it to a lvl 2. This can lead to pushes with immediate lvl 2s or even lvl3s with core. It also would only help on defense when your turret is destroyed and it is a team fight which isn’t too powerful, but still good.So thoughts, anything to add, or think torb is fine.

Adding Lucio and anyone Lucio is near to the list is a bit much...and i think that is just fine. Moira, Bastion, Mei, Zarya, Ana, Reaper, Lucio: SHOULD junkrat remain strong against these heroes? what about their perspective?I literally just said he wasn't strong against them because his trap/mine combo doesn't work on them, but I'll put that down to a misunderstanding... I think it would be like if Mei's freeze+icicle worked on even less heroes... it's an important part of her kit. Junkrat is actually strong against Doomfist, but that's largely due to his big hitbox and his need to deal damage up close. Zarya can make him a huge liability. It's not like the guy doesn't have his counters, I think one of the reasons people are so mad is because he's more common in games these days and he can be frustrating, and they experience that much more... but I don't think that's only due to his buffs, a lot of things that irritate people existed before those...I think it's okay to look at making some minor changes to him, but it's important for people to consider a way that doesn't remove him from viability entirely. I'd be happy to see Roadhog completely gone, but Roadhog mains don't want that so all I can do is shrug my shoulders and accept that I'll always run into him from time to time.

"780","Posted by AngryPuckmendam can you at least read my previous post, the delay and voice line of sombra coming out of stealth IS INTENTIONAL as having a hero that seemingly can appear and disappear with no warning is as broken as broken can get also i don't under stand what your problem with D.va is as she is a rather easy target for sombra shoot a bit build some charge wait for her to pull up matrix and hack to stop further abilitiesalso you can bait a D.va's missiles with a teleport then punish her hard after she burns her abilities, also stay at least 4-5 meters away from d.va as at distance you can burn her mech down rather easily without taking much damage.also on a side note she's not the assassin type of character and should only really be cleaning up enemies with less then half health or of course annoy the hell out of the tanks so there not paying attention to their allies  and again you have to think of her gun more as a shot-gun than a riffle as it is extream potent against tanks and other large to mid-size hit box charactersand whats with the EMP hate? its one of the best set-up ults in the game giving teammates ample time to push in and wipe the enemy team (again she's not designed to be an assassin)one top of that if played right can easily be one of the fastest charging ults in the game even faster than tracer's pulse bombso quite frankly if your not utilizing her utility properly and are soely focused on trying to assassinate the enemy than you have failed to see the power in her kitHave a seat, let me deconstruct this for you.Having the delay on Stealth was a bad intention, so many other heroes can catch someone by surprise and kill them instantly like Genji or Tracer, even Junkrat.  Tracer can blink in your face three times and blast you with one clip, Junkrat can launch himself up in the air shoot you once then throw mine at you and boom you’re dead, Genji can quickly shoot a few Shurikens at your head, swift strike through you, turn around and use your own abilities against you with his Deflect, but yet Sombra can’t come out of Stealth without saying an entire sentence having the entire team notice her before she can even shoot one bullet?? Umm.. HELLOOO!! Shes a STEALTH HERO.. thats what they do, catch you by suprise!! That doesn’t make her OP, that just fits her playstyle, if you know theirs an enemy Sombra, be aware of her flanking you!! It’s not rocket science to make a 180° turn and fight back, especially when your team is there with you. I mean cmon, Blizzard acts like Sombra coming out of Stealth turns her weapon into a giant nuclear laser that melts your insides.. Sombra deserves to at least be on level with Genji and Tracer people have been saying that for over a year now if anything, it's only helping her get out of the blackhole she's stuck in.Also D.VA is not a problem at all it’s very easy to get her out of her Mech, you weren’t paying attention to the problem, the point is that D.VAs little pellets across the map take you out of Stealth with 1 damage which is ridiculous, Sombras abilities get canceled more than the enemies shes trying to hack, that’s just not right. Sombra can be very effective being a disruptor dealing a bit of damage than teleporting away to farm her EMP, but her ultimate should not be her #1 priority when it comes to good viability. Sombra is only viable because of her EMP, hence why everyone literally uses her as a Support, even the OWL uses her to fill a Support Slot because all she can do is farm her EMP and give heals, while not dealing enough damage.  Sombra needs power shifted away from her constant EMP farming, and more power onto her actual kit so she can be more viable on her own without having to hold her teammates hands after she spent the entire game teleporting back and forth intentionally taking damage to gain ultimate charge?? Not to mention her Machine Pistol spread.. how is she supposed to be the hero that “finishes people off” if she can’t even get to the low HP enemy thats most likely behind their teammates, and theirs a 99% chance that you’ll get shot out of Stealth forcing you to teleport away, not even getting the finish on them. Even if you don’t have to get near them, its not like you can shoot them at a distance either, her Weapon spread is ridiculous so the bullets are hardly ever going to hit them to finish them off, Sombras gun acts like a target thats 10 feet away is actually far away on another planet.A stealth hero like Sombra has so much potential yet she acts like a broken record going back and forth. There was even a bug when she was first released that allowed players to get rid of the Stealth delay and it worked fine and felt way smoother than what it is now and it wasn’t OP at all. And ofcourse, Sombra is already pretty good, but any hero can be good for the little amount of players that invest so much time into playing them, but that doesn’t make the hero good or the other 99% of the playerbase.Sure, Blizzard might’ve said they don’t want Sombra to be an assassin, but that was a year ago, look how their plan turned out, all Sombra is, is an EMP bot that is counted as a Support Hero. It makes no sense. It’s been over a year and Sombra has been more worthless than Doomfist considering her release date.Blizzard has to change Sombra, they didn’t like how Mercy and D.VA were Resurrect bots and Defense Matrix bots, so they reworked them and even gave them new abilities, Sombra needs the same treatment.",-0.0337078651685393,"TRUE"

"808","Posted by UkeNickyAgreed. He's become a problem lately. Now listen, I understand Pharah hard counters him and she's a strong hero in general but it's just a little ridiculous that she's one of the only solid counters to him. Widows and Hanzos are encouraged to step it up and try to take him down but it's just really jarring how most of the cast can't do much against a good Junkrat. I especially feel bad for Doomfist. He just can't do anything against a Junkrat it's like getting hacked but you get murdered by Junk instead. I'm not necessarily in favor of nerfing Junkrat though, his counters need to be buffed, we just need more ways of dealing with him, that's all. Although I would not be biased to him hurting himself again with his own explosives. Do the mines need to be nerfed? Honestly I don't think so, they really have given him the much needed mobility and versatility he's needed. Making him hurt himself again would be a simple revert that would punish incredibly reckless Junkrats from just, well, being reckless. A good Junk keeps some order to his chaos and that's what makes them good. Whether you like it or not he can put out an absurd amount of damage without thinking at all and something should be done about that.Doomfist can't do anything against anything.

"886","Somebody made a post on the forum a while ago about how you could buff Mei but i cant find it so to paraphrase what i remember:Mei should be a counter to speed characters like tracer who doesnt have a reliable hard counter. Even a good gengi can be countered by a decent winston. Tracer on the other hand... mcree is a high skill hero that few people can actually reliably counter tracer with, people rarely pick torb and get flammed when they do and sym isnt a great choice either (especially with moiras orb atm) , and those are some of tacers best counters. even the pros just pick another tracer to counter tracer and no hero should require you to pick the same hero to counter it. So onto Mei. Her spray already reduces movement speed but by the time it freezes an enemy they can get in, kill their target and get out before being frozen. Even though people complain about mei's freeze,  theirs a reason shes not popular in death match and rarely used at diamond and above. So now the actual mei buff:-1 SLIGHTLY increase her freeze speed or SLIGHTLY increase its range maybe 1 or 2 meters-2 Her ice spray reduces the distance travelled of movement skills, so once you start being sprayed, your blink/ dash/ leap/ jump jet/ doomfist/ boosters etc has its effectiveness (travel distance) reduced over time. It takes about 1.5 seconds to freeze an enemy so for every 0.5 secs you lose 1/3 of the travel distance of a movement skill while her chill effect is in place.-3 Icicle has a slow effect that lasts for 0.5 seconds. Example:  D.va is being sprayed by mei and uses boosters to escape (12m travel distance). 0.5s of being sprayed = 8m travelled by boosters, 1second of being sprayed = on 4 meters travelled by boosters and 1.5s sprayed = frozen.So in short, She should be the character that speed based heroes are afraid to get close to.

"1052","Now some of these may be a skosh outdated (or lack extensive testing) but, I saw a thread asking people to share 1 tip about their main (or Mein; in my case) and I couldn't decide on 1 tip! So I compiled a list of little tips that I have found to be valuable and that I have learned in my time playing Mei so far and I wanted to share my knowledge! Now I know Mei could use some QOL changes and a few tweaks here or there but, regardless of that, I really enjoy her and always have! So here goes nothing. I hope you guys enjoy and make use of these!Mei Tips:-You can freeze somebody in a couple seconds with primary fire. The stream from Mei's gun is actually more of consecutive ""puffs,"" if you will, (Like tiny clouds) than an actual stream of fire. The best policy for a quick freeze is to aim, as closely as possible to an enemy and where the enemy WILL BE as oppose to where they currently are. Because Mei's weapon is not hitscan, this results in a more reliable freeze. This helps, particularly, with denying mobile heroes.-On that same note, it is best to attempt a freeze on heroes after they have used their escapes. I.E. A Genji who has just dashed into your back line, a tracer who is absent-mindedly blinking and recalling, a Sombra who has just trans-located, a Moira who has just phased, etc.-Mei's freeze is a great tool for not only securing kills but interrupting enemies. Flank and bum-rush heroes mid-ult to be extra annoying.Most of the time a McRee or a Road Hog are ulting, they are focusing on getting kills; not you. This can result in a reliable stop to many ults and sometimes a kill. Heck, it can even be useful to interrupt healing!-Zarya can bubble frozen heroes to cleanse a freeze. You can also activate her personal bubble as she is about to freeze to cleanse the slow and deny an impending freeze.-If you listen closely to the sound being broadcast as somebody comes close to freezing, you can actually time RMB just right and hit enemies right as they freeze. This can result in you being able to land up to a triple headshot on heroes. Combined with a punch, at the end, this can kill even some Tanks.-You can use Mei's Ice Block as cover - similar to her wall. (You can also Iceblock on top of frozen enemies and create extra cover for allies) I have jumped in front of a D.Va bomb and saved allies many times (Or so it appears).-Mei's iceblock can also be canceled early. This can help take enemies off-guard or helps you to avoid being trapped and mined by a Junkrat (Junk Mine can 1-shot Mei due to her hitbox)-Mei Iceblock now cleanses Ana grenade (This was a 2+ year-long bug)-Mei wall can be put under your feet or allied hero's feet to break Junkrat traps instantly (It can also be used on enemies postmortem for hilarious body launches).-Similarly, you can actually place a Mei wall under your own feet and jump right as it peaks to avoid being hurt by a Doomfist ult; when timed properly it completely avoids it.-Another fun thing is to place a wall between you and the enemy team as soon as a Zarya ult lands (Remember, you can drop your wall whenever you feel like it). You can also wall-off Mcree ults this way. This can really take people off-guard or even lure enemies into a false sense of security only to have your wall dropped and them ulted.-Use her wall to sneak around choke points guarded by Torb turrets or Bastions. Each pillar can eat 500 or so damage before breaking.-Mei wall eats Moira orbs and can completely ruin her planned trajectory for them.-You can also use Mei's wall to trap enemies in allied hero ults such as Road Hog or Pharah or Secure a Doomfist punch kill.-When dueling a Doomfist, as Mei, you can win every time. Just wait for him to let out a rocket punch and block it with an ability, do the same as he tries to spam abilities and, with proper tracking, you'll freeze and icicle his face in no time (Just try to avoid dueling close to walls).-Similarly, you can block Rein charges.-Mei wall shines when it is used to split enemy teams and secure kills. It can, however, also be used defensively to negate nasty ults like a D.Va bomb. You can use it to wall yourself into corners, indoors, to save yourself from Winstons, Genjis, and other ults too. I recommend blocking Moira ult, Road Hog Ult, and D.Va Ult with it. You can even block some junkrat ults with good timing.-Use Mei wall to sneak up into high positions and freeze enemy snipers. Note that they will be the bane of your existence in-game but, even some experienced snipers suffer from tunnel vision and will fall victim to a freeze and the following abrupt icicle lobotomy; without proper attention.-Fun Fact: You can use Mei Wall, when placed under your feet and far enough onto the corner, on the second point of Hanamura to sneak in the back way. Just jump as you reach the edge of your wall and you will make it!-Mei's RMB can 1-shot a Tracer if you can plant one in her noggin. It is also one of the fastest ways to charge your ult. Be sure to try and land headshots on Tanks like D.VA &amp; Road Hog. They can basically be your personal ult battery.-Fun Fact: Mei's ult requires a little longer to charge than your average ult.-Use Mei icicles in your downtime to poke and charge your ult and to harass Pharahs. Even though it has fall-off damage, the poke you provide can help secure kills and ward off pesky attackers/flankers - even if you aren't getting head shots. Remember, Mei's icicle also has a slight arc at longer ranges. An experienced Mei can out-duel other long-range heroes at mid-range. Just time the RMB fire delay right!-Be sure to flank unsuspecting Reinhardts (Especially if you can catch them alone). You can shoot a freeze ray up their butts and stun them - effectively locking them out of their barrier and potentially exposing the enemy team or securing a kill. It should also be noted that you can literally run circles around some Reins and use your primary fire to freeze them even if they are trying to block you.-During Mei ult, you can freeze somebody with primary fire in less than a second (with good aim). Use this on heroes you know can escape (Which is most of them). You can also lightly touch heroes with your primary and they will freeze in the order you specify. As far as I know, as long as they are in your ult, they will stay frozen. For this reason, Mei Ult never actually NEEDS to be paired with any other ult. Just mop up some free Popsicle kills.-FUN FACT: Roughly 25 of the heroes have a very high chance of escaping your ult if they are paying attention.-In regards to her ult, the best policy is to throw it when you are unseen. You can throw it straight up to delay its activation or you can simply throw it behind the enemy team, when pushing, and they will back into it. Alternatively, use your wall to close the enemy team's escape. No need to be shy, get in there and start shooting some icicles!-Mei's ult can be canceled by D.Va Matrix or even deflected by a skilled Genji; before it lands. Keep this in mind as a deflected Mei ult can wind up securing your enemy a team kill.-Mei ult also freezes enemies slightly above or below it.-Mei shines on payload maps. Her little body can actually effectively hide behind almost every single payload; when she crouches. This protects you from 90+% of enemy fire and snipers and forces them to run up to the payload to get you off of it. This puts them right in freezing range. Wall them off, freeze them, and secure a kill on your over-extended and unprotected new friend.-Mei is a-mei-zing at staling points and payloads. Many Meins don't like the fact that this is part of her character but, it serves teams well often enough. Use your wall and iceblock to be pesky and stall points until your team arrives. This is exceptionally helpful during overtime.-Mei can function as an off-tank when played well.-As Mei, Snipers, discord orbs, and Pharah's will prove tough to handle. Use LOS well and practice countering people. Discord orb falls off after 3 seconds out of Zen's LOS (So does Harmony). #Itgetsbetter.-Lastly, Mcree will be your arch nemesis. Bait out his flash bang, in close range, and Iceblock or wall to negate it. After that, dance around and freeze him. If he doesn't headshot you at least twice, you will probably win the duel. Don't forget: There is a slight delay between iceblock and wall activation that lets bullets and effects through. This can result in a canceled Iceblock and death or getting headshot through your wall. Time it appropriately.Have fun my little Ice Queens!",-0.325153374233129,"TRUE"

I don't think she needs any changes outside of the healing orb not being able to get eaten by DVA/Reflected by genji.

Still no arguments address the fact she has a near perfect pickrate and is always the choice.I am just arguing that we should not only judge a hero's power-level based on pick-rate alone, but also take the role into account. Otherwise there is going to be constant nerfs to Mercy until we come to a tipping point where it makes no sense playing Mercy at all. Mercy fulfils a unique role as the only dedicated healer that focuses solely on keeping team-members alive, and as such she'll have the highest pick-rate even if she ends up being completely balanced... If they keep nerfing her at that point just because she still has high pick-rate she'll end up being underpowered.Well ya that's the point she needs to hit a tipping point then possibly get a small buff after.

Being a projectile, the arrows are actually somewhat easy to predict and avoid in comparison to widowmakers hitscan. 250 damage headshots vs 300 damage. Widowmaker is best at medium- long range. A hanzo close trumps you due to scattershot and quicker arrow charge. Widowmaker's hook is far better than wall climb, but its on a cooldown so it averages out imo. Try running from a winston or dva as hanzo... Try getting around reinhardt shield as hanzo... get to the top of the map as hanzo...  Killing pharah is FAR easier with widowmaker, as well as mercy and other high mobility characters minus scatter shot. Widowmaker and hanzo both have their situations that one is better than the other, but skill makes up the difference. A god tier widow will be useful where a ""decent"" hanzo is not, and vice versa.

"1472","Posted by UkeNickyPosted by FreshKill14I want to get this off my chest, I love playing Junkrat, he was one of the first heroes I play next to Reaper (which explains the massive hours on them, currently I flex when I can). I was tired of seeing Junkrat in F-tier for so long that it felt like a miracle that Junkrat was getting buffed with two mines and tire speed increase.While I love Junkrat, however I feel he is a bit too “easy” to use than before which is one reason I don’t play him as much.I don’t share the sentiment of most Junkrat complainers wanting him to be nerfed back to F-tier, calling him “no-skill”, and even insulting other Junkrat players. I have been “in between” regarding Junkrat changes, as a Junkrat players I feel he is fine and the people are overreacting, but as a non-Junkrat player I can see why some people complain about him making it difficult for me to pick a side.I can guarantee if Blizzard is smart in toning down Junkrat so that he is still viable, I am sure it may help the game balance in the long run though I understand Junkrat players will feel upset about those changes believe me, I share that sentiment if he gets nerfed.TLDR: Junkrat is one of my favorite heroes in the game that it pains me wanting him toned down a bit. I don’t share the sentiment of most Junkrat complainers wanting him back to crap. However, can other Junkrat players convince me that he is fine, I will be open to your feedback.I'm joking so please don't get mad at me but you're just mad that he gets insta locked before you can pick him huh ;PHa, there is some truth to itBut surprisingly I see more Genji, Hanzo, and Widowmaker in QPWhenever I want to play Junkrat, he is usually available",0.142857142857143,"FALSE"

I just wanted to chime in, because there’s definitely some confusion around one-tricking, and we wanted to take a moment to clarify our philosophy as a development team.We believe players can choose to play any available hero during any game at any time, and that their choice of hero alone is not a behavior that should be penalized by our customer service team under any of the player report categories (including griefing, inactivity, or poor teamwork).We believe players should be evaluated based on their actions with whichever hero they choose. If a player disrupts their team by intentionally feeding with ANY hero, you should report that player for griefing. If a player is staying in the spawn area, refuses to attack the enemy, or refuses support those that are, you should report that player for inactivity. If a player actively refuses to play the map’s objectives or communicates to the team in a negative fashion, you should report that player for poor teamwork. If a player communicates in a hateful or harassing manner with ANY hero, you should report that player for abusive chat. However, if a teammate is actively trying to perform well on their hero and help their team, they should NOT be reported under any category.Players who inaccurately submit player reports in an attempt to punish someone’s hero choice are considered to be harassing or griefing their fellow player, and inaccurate reports make it more difficult for us to appropriately action the players who DO disrupt the game.

History of The TrifectaFor an entire year, Mei has been considered ""F-tier"" since her niche only functions either stall a point at the end of overtime, or to slow enemies that have no movement or protection abilities of any kind: Zenyatta, Roadhog, Ana, Bastion, Torjborn, McCree (kindof). That's only 6 heroes that don't have any real capacity to evade her freeze, and the ones that don't have some sort of damage output to make it hard to even Mei to freeze said heroes. It is especially bad when her only form of range is a projectile that is in fact the ONLY projectile subjected to fall off damage. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwC6QVpn8MkAfter the Ana issue with her becoming the new OP and Must-Pick, the developers have become wary of any incident like that happening again when releasing a new hero. As such, Sombra had the most underwhelming reveal and hasn't moved in popularity and winrate for her entire existence since. Not to mention the fact that she has - and still is - riddled with bugs that detriment her kit overall with so many ability delays and has a ridiculously large spread in her primary that can't compete with other DPS like Soldier or Tracer. Symmetra long ago had the unique mechanic of Photon Shield, which gave allies permanent shield health until the targeted ally died, this was toned down immensely since it meant heroes with 150hp at the time like Tracer, Genji, and Zenyatta were able to benefit from Sym overall. While Symmetra wasn't considered OP, she was a bi-product of a combo that was considered OP. It was at this point that they flat out changed it to an ultimate and filled the Ability slot for Photon Barrier, which not only has a niche usage, but can' really compare to the original strength of Photon Shield. Even then and now, you can't really consider Symmetra over any healer since they have better utility overall. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdirotiA9hshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7n-1sEoZHQUPosted by SilentStormThe Trifecta's design their downfallMei has a projectile fall off, intentionally making her horrible in far range where she lacks. Mei's Ice Wall intentionally is a troll ability by design since your team can't see through the wall which makes it a detriment to your team if they can't see what's going on. Comparing to Reaper, he has a CC immune ability that allows him to move for 3 seconds and is able to reload to have the upper hand; a Mei gets stuck in place, doesn't reload, and no protection to ward people from swarming your Cryofreeze. If they're not gonna add anything to it, they should at least decrease the cooldown. Sombra has a delay to go in and out of Stealth, incredibly weak threshold on her abilities, long as cooldown on Hack and Stealth to make her unable to actually be ready to use them, and a ridiculously large spread that makes her the worst in terms of reliable DPS. Not to mention the bug issue, you can't expect me to believe that Sombra is comparably reliable to a Soldier or Tracer. Symmetra's turret has a 1.4 casting time, 10 meter dmg range, 25% speed reduction that can stack, with a 10 second cooldown with each turret, all of which have 1 HP. First of all, no one finds it fun to have a turret nest at a choke or in a room, not the enemy, not even the Sym player as it is mind-numblingly boring to do so. Secondly, having all of your turrets nested around a choke hitting 1 person is easily 120 dps with a 150% speed reduction; IF all do hit without being destroyed, and that is a big IF, cause most tanks can easily take them out, and with the newly added Moira can easily destroy the nest without hassle with her Biotic Orb and Grasp. Thirdly, it takes 30 seconds to build 3 new turrets, that is the same cooldown as a Mercy Rez, I'm not here to believe that bringing back someone from the dead is as important as building 3 1HP turrets.Lastly, Torbjorn has a better utility with his singular turret since his have 150 instant health that can gain 150+ health and damage more with a constant range of 40 meters. And with her Photon Barrier, the shape of the shield only helps if you're moving forward in chokes, it doesn't protect you from the sides nor behind; it doesn't have a very strong purpose other than to protect quick ults or to protect yourself, but even then you have a ridiculously long cooldown of 10 seconds that supposed to move without any control; a lot can easily happen in under 10 seconds that would be hard to protect.To sum it up, I can't expect to believe something as unreliable as these abilities with a big cooldown would help my team and myself in any non-niche way.Developer Recognition and AcknowledgmentMei's megathread on page 69 got acknowledgement of the fact that the page is being monitored, but many can agree that waiting over 2 weeks for anything else than that is not enough. She also got acknowledgement from Reddit of a bug thread that they'll look into. https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759356748#post-1https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/7ko6mx/mei_bug_list_with_examples/While the Sombra megathread hasn't got an acknowledgement post, we at least got a post from the bug megathread (one that I and many others have helped with) with it only acknowledging what has been categorized as ""fixed"" and the open response of hearing all the issues that aren't actually fixed. 2 weeks later and we've pretty much disproved the fact that the bugs have gone away, they still riddle Sombra and we still wait for any response or acknowledgement. https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760826184?page=1https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759587944?page=1https://youtu.be/soqdrpbbS-Q?t=2m17sThe outlier here is that Symmetra's megathread that has over 200 pages with no recognition whatsoever with any blue post. None. Many people - including myself - suggesting ideas and concepts on how to fix her without Sym becoming OP, but even still, I've seen a Lucio thread that asked for his ult to be buffed with a blue post saying that he's fine the way he is; my question is where is that response for Symmetra? https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759380928?page=1https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759517867#post-14To sum it up simplyWe need a better response for all of us so we can know if our fight for our mains is worth fighting for. It's tiring to believe from the lack of responses that with over 310 pages in total have been been all for naught because none of this will be even be shown in the PTR, we don't know and it's frustrating.

People claiming that it will always make Mercy a must-have clearly missed the tank aka Ana meta.What killed Ana was Winston’s buff and the dive meta that followed.So I agree that resurrect could be balanced - it was.  The offensive options being op is why the meta began favoring high mobility and the ability to resurrect instagibbed allies.Having said that, old resurrect was a complaint for many, but really it was because it felt bad when it countered your efforts.  When a big resurrect had that impact, it generally meant the offense screwed up and blew all their ultimates.  Rather than accept that, they cried until it was removed.And hide and seek Mercy was usually a losing strategy.  Most good Mercy players didn’t hide, they avoided being caught in ultimates, while supporting their team 99% of the time.Ironically, I now find myself hiding far more than ever to avoid rip tires every 30 seconds, as there’s no other way to avoid it reliably.",0.25,"FALSE"

"1854","Posted by BattleAxPosted by MangoHad seasons actually had some form of soft reset, smurfs wouldnt be as rampant as they are. When you can and do significantly change rank on a smurf vs your main account its no surprise theres a massive increase in smurfs. They did it for season 2 and not again since which is stupid. I dont know another game (please, let me know) that doesnt reset each season and starts you from where you left off minus a 100+sr.While I do like this idea, not everyone would like if they had to start all over.But to me this sounds like a great solution.True, itll likely upset a few people but like I said, I dont know a game that doesnt do a reset, when other major games do I dont get why OW doesnt. Plus those that get really upset over it would likely be those that are likely carried and riding past season highs, as to paraphrase an argument thrown around alot ""if youre good, youll climb"" thus if youre a good player, youll get a good rank. A hard reset would have a !@#$show in MM, whilst a soft would maintain MM in that you should be placing against people of the same level from last season and losses will have you face lower ranks and wins would have you facing higher ranks etc. Point being, as it stands seasons are irrelevant and serve no purpose other than to give the devs some maintenance time or whatever hence theyre like 2-3 days gap between seasons.

Pfff naaaaah. Think we'll lower the prices to be something actually reasonable to grind for in the short window you have? Like maybe 500 or 750? HAHAHA NAH! How about a lootbox sale where everything is 50% off so you can at least have a better chance of getting something you want without as much of a sting to your wallet? What nonsense!We're busy scrooge mcducking into our money vaults as EA takes an enormous publicity hit for a game mechanic we popularized. Because we can hide under the ""it's only cosmetics"" excuse as if people inherently don't care about what they look like. Graphics aren't important afterall, let's all just play as black stick figures since ""it's only cosmetic"" oh wait it is actually important that's why it's such an enormous money maker. Ehrm, forget we said that last bit!TY for the money, here's a 50% off sale to our premium priced game that's almost 2 years old without a single price drop.

With competitive rewards Blizzard did a great job specifying, before the mode was even added, that Competitive Player Icons and sprays would always be limited time, forever missable items. They are consistent and self explanatory. It's hard to confuse that an icon or spray aptly named 'Season 5 Contender' will ever be available again. A simple icon named Red Envelope, though? Or one named 2017? No indication in their names, images, or tooltip that they will be removed from next year's loot boxes.

Bragging is neither here nor there. I've always been fine with permanently missable collectors items; it's Blizzard's approach that I find strange this time around. Blizzard likes to showcase how transparent they are with their community, and they usually are, but removing items from loot boxes without so much as mentioning it in the patch notes I find meaner than the usual Blizzard status quo.Plus the removed player icons in question were implemented before the Lootbox recoding earlier this year. One could have played every day of Winter Wonderland and Chinese New Year and never got either icon. There's nothing wrong with tough luck.

What I'm thinking is that maybe, just maybe, we might be getting a new PVE based on these four characters. But this is just my thoughts and it'd kinda make logical sense when you come to think about it.In Moira's origin story, we're gifted with bits of information that relate to her experiments, mainly one that presents Gabriel Reyes looking at himself in awe while black-like smoke slither off his body, perhaps displaying his ability to wraith and shadow step. This would explain his power without relating to the fact that he got them when he died. Imagine it, Reaper, McCree, Genji and Moira in their Blackwatch related skins fighting off Omnics or any other type of enemy, just like in the Uprising mode. Now the biggest concern with this is that there's three offence heroes and one healer. In Uprising, we had the choice of one of each role. Tracer, Torbjörn, Reinhardt and Mercy. Now I can only assume that the map layout and game-mode will function through teamwork while causing havoc. Also, think of the interactions and the witty banter they'll share with each other.Obviously, I can't confirm nothing, this was just a thought that I had in mind of what might come in the future.

"2201","Hi all,We’re making a change on our PTR servers shortly (no patch required!), that reworks some of how our heroes move and accelerate. This was originally done to fix bugs on a couple heroes, but the changes are systemic and affect all Heroes.   Specifically, movement on the ground is much more consistent. Going up/down inclines will no longer affect the Hero’s speed.  Previously, inclines could either make you move slightly faster or slightly slower, depending on the circumstances. Inclines will also no longer cause a small amount of strafing movement when moving diagonally on them.   A side effect of these changes is characters will now have slightly better air control.   For example, Winston previously was not able to easily make small adjustments to his flight path during his Jump Pack leap, but now he should be able to do that, and it is also noticeable on many of the other Heroes that are often in the air.We think these changes will overall be great improvements but there might be some unintended side effects that we’d love your help finding on the PTR!Thanks!",0.5,"FALSE"

"2255","I've always wondered this, and am now adding it into my thoughts with Moira about all the supports' self-healing abilities. This is excluding ultimates.Mercy heals 20hp/s after a one-second buffer.Moira heals through damaging, at 33hp/s, or with her 10-second CD orb that does 75hp/s for a maximum of 300 HP healed in total/heals any ally near it who is damaged.Lucio heals for 12hp/s only with the correct song which has a .8-second CD to swap between the two, and does 35hp/s for three seconds on a 12-second CD.Zenyatta heals 30 shields/second after not taking damage for three seconds. This cannot heal his 50 hp, only his 150 shields.Ana can only heal herself with her grenade that has a 10-second CD, and it heals 100hp for anyone within the radius of it, but also damages enemies, buffs healing recieved for all allied targets and prevents enemies from receiving any form of healing for four seconds.Symmetra has less shields than Zenyatta, with 100, only able to heal 30hp/s after not getting hit for three seconds._____Now, I'm wondering this: why does Mercy ( and now Moira ) have such overpowered self-healing compared to the other supports? I'm probably one of the only people that want Moira's self-healing through her damage nerfed ( preferably halved, that way it's between Mercy and shields in some sense ), Mercy's self-healing nerfed ( and not work how it does in her ult, just keep it the same normally ), and Ana, Zenyatta and Lucio's self-healing buffed.I suggest that Mercy's self healing change to two second wait time for 10 or 15hp/s ( and not always heal during her ult ). People argue that ""she's a support, she has no defense by herself and needs it"". This is false. She has a gun, she has teammates. Just because she's in a solo situation by herself does not automatically mean she's allowed to have the most powerful healing in the game. Put anyone else in that situation. They work out just fine, and so can Mercy, but she has more self-healing instead of damage, despite her damage still being pretty decent.Preferably I'd like Ana to have something similar to Mercy's self-healing, but on a nerfed scale, and her grenade's healing and damage nerfed a bit, but keep the cooldown the same. Ana has self-healing on a ten-second cooldown, and she must choose to either use it on herself, an enemy, or her teammates. This is ridiculous.Lucio's self-healing is a constant passive so long as he has his healing up and not his speed boost. He doesn't even get healed for as much as he can heal others, and I have to wonder why this is.Moira should not heal for as much as she does. ""Requiring aim for her to heal"" is not a trade-off argument in this situation, because she HAS to aim in order to get her primary ally healing back. With a little bit of practice it seems anyone can play her pretty well; she's easy to pick up and is a main healer like Mercy, but with much more damage and self-healing. Her orb is fine in my opinion because she, like Ana, has to choose on damage or healing, but this, too, can be sucked up by D.Va or reflected by Genji, but at least she can just automatically start sucking the life out of enemies for her own self-healing, and on a massive scale. She's barely a support, she's basically just a hybrid of Soldier and Symmetra with Zenyatta's shtick of harmony/discord and orbs. I'm probably one of the only people that want her nerfed.Zenyatta and Symmetra are a different matter entirely. Neither of them can fully heal themselves, and must wait three seconds without being hit to even start the process. You get hit? Good luck, another three seconds. They have no mobility. Zenyatta has it even less than Symmetra does in some sense because Symmetra has a shield ability she can throw out, and her turrets for some protection, but Zen does not. There's clear differences between the two and that's damage and support ability; Symmetra buffs teams, Zenyatta debuffs enemies. Their damage is similar, but Zen without his orb does more, has range, but is projectile VS Symmetra's ( knowingly-bugged ) lock-on beam that cannot be reflected or headshot. The pair need something that isn't shields for self-healing. It would feel wrong giving both of them something that isn't shields in my opinion; Zen could have an auto-repair thing like Bastion does, and Symmetra could just have self-healing like Mercy, but still give shields with her ult. Hell, you could even let Zenyatta orb himself, but then that'd be a similar situation to Ana: self or ally.Just my quickly thought-up two cents.TL;DR- Nerf Moira and Mercy self-healing.- Give Ana and Symmetra similar regen qualities like Mercy and remove Symmetra's starting shields in favor of just pure HP.- Have Lucio's self-healing buffed.- Remove Zenyatta's shields and add pure HP, and give him a self-repair like Bastion, or let him orb himself.",0.371428571428571,"FALSE"
"2256","Let me just lay it down as it is.Yes, Mercy gets full hp after 11 seconds of staying out of combat if she has 1hp left, but it is interupted by any and all damage. Let's not forget it takes a whole second to heal 20hp, it's only 1 hp more than a 76 bullet. Provided you can shoot her every second she won't regenerate hp.Yes, Moira get 33 hp/s, but literally any dps worth their salt can kill her faster than she can regenerate. If she has her Orb up. Retreat, swallow your pride and fall back. Don't want her to regen hp? Attack from behind a shield, she'll either have to get past the shield, waste her orb or run. And she can't take 2 people on at once alone.Yes, Ana gets 100 hp/nade and the nade takes 10 seconds to cooldown. BUT the nade is a game changing ability as it can block all healing for 3 seconds. (except shield regen)  and can deny Life saving healing and can add a 1.5* multiplier to allied healing which is huge. If she didn't have to use it to heal herself, the effect would be staggering.Zenyatta has shields as He's a combat/dps hybrid along with Moira. Both have 30hp/s healing as they're expected to dip in and out  of combat frequently having toned down healing would lower his uptimes as he's already slow and very weak to dive.Lucio has weak healing as he has plenty of other tools to escape his enemies. He can speed away after booping enemies and wallriding further increases his ability to escape. Compare and contrast to Moira who only has 1 fade on a 6 second CD and almost every DPS has a way of keeping up with her should they decide to give chase but has a stronger 33hp/s healing to compensate.Lastly there's Symmetra. She's nothing special, not a trained war veteran, doesn't have any special healing technology to patch her up. Her Shields and Light constructs are all she has. Removing her shield hp and replacing it with normal hp would not only change a large part if the character it would also make her less susceptible to sombra's EMP, which counters a dispropotionately large part of her kit already as though they designed Sombra to counter Symmetra.",-0.3,"TRUE"

"2260","Note: I cannot understand why there's a massive dislike band on support topics. English is not my native language, but there's a clear distinction between ""dislike"" and ""disagree"". We should respect others opinion.Back to our topic.Posted by NickelangeloMoira doesn't need a nerf. Her self heal doesn't do squat when being focused by any dps. I agree that at gold and below her skill floor allows her to 1v1 easier, but in plat any dps can kill her easily. Her orb needs to not focus syms turrents, that's it.I don't think OP supports that Moira is OP in 1v1, in comparison with other supports. Moira along with an out of cds Ana need the most time to duel as a flanker. However, Ana needs her cooldowns to duel, while Moira not; In tight maps, like the controls, it's almost impossible to kill her (given that her team has awareness). She just needs a tremendous time to be killed, so she doesn't worth the time. It's better to kill fast other key targets like junkrat (for the shields), the second healer etc. Second she is the only support that can cheat death from dedicated flanker (Tracer and Genji) ulties with her teleport.IMO, Moira will be nerfed for sure, no matter how much we argue in favour or against her. The reason is simple; her competitive winning rates are just too high for a new hero and she has unreal average stats (combo of high elims, final blows, healing and low deaths). She is 4th (platinum stats) in Eliminations over Deaths ratio behind from D.Va, Torb and Zarya. DVa and Torb were always in the E:D first places due to their mechanics and survability.After examining the stats I wonder: Should a support have a place there? As you already know there are a lot of topics about Genji's and Tracer's survivability, but Moira is in a better position right now.There are a lot of people around who believe that Moira is fine. Can you support your arguments through statistics? Stats are objective facts, while ""a Tracer can kill Moira"" is very subjective, because this is a 6v6 game and not a 1v1 deathmatch. In papers, Tracer deals exactly 400 dmg with 1 clip if she only headshots. Have you ever seen a double kill against 2 full health dps with 1 clip? That's why stats matter.",0.4,"FALSE"

"2266","You bring up a good points Echo, however, concerning your argument that Symmetra, Ana, and Zenyatta have less self healing I believe is a bit misleading. Self healing is not the only factor in survivability. Keep in mind, Symmetra and Zennyatta have significantly more damage the the others. Becoming quasi-DPS at times. A spatially aware Zennyata with decent aim can RMB one shot characters chasing them down, especially around corners and chokes. Meanwhile Symmetra's laser does a significant amount of damage, on top of her area denial with turrets, killing the Symmetra is not always as easy as you might think. Their self defense capabilities I think make up for their lower sustained healing. Also, Ana has her sleep dart. If she is getting dived or harassed, you can just sleep them. Yes, she has less self healing, but her shutdown potential makes up for that in my opinion. Also, Moira has to get very close to the enemy for her self healing, often that can be very risky, if the enemy team is dive heavy. For instance, yes your regenerating 33 hp/s, which is quite good. But if you have a Tracer diving you, you'll still die in a couple seconds, if that. That said, mercy's self heal seems a bit copious comparatively. Perhaps make it 2 seconds before it starts?

If its defense then you shouldn't be diving a lot of the time.Winston jump CD is shorter than genji dash, also most winstons don't waste their jump needlessly.

You're assuming that all people beyond yourself have an equally likely chance of leaving a game, and that only one person will leave the game during its match. This in and of itself is flawed logic as anyone who has ever been in a match with a leaver knows that other people can also leave during the match. However, let's ignore that. Your supposition is that for every leaving match there are 11 members who might leave. 6 out of those 11 members on the opposing team. 5 out of those 11 on your team. Or (because you were not kind enough to calculate your own proofs) there is a 54.5% chance of the leaver being on the opposite team and a 45.5% chance of that leaver being on your team. (Those are good odds for a casino, bad odds for just about anything else.)Of course,  your argument also hinges on the belief that oneself will never be the leaver. This is statistically dodgy at best as, should you lose power or connection, you yourself will be the leaver. This makes it back to 50% chance you will be on the leaving team. You cannot discount yourself from a calculation because there is a chance, no matter how slim, that you will be the leaver. And each person similarly has a different chance they will leave a game - whether through a statistically worse internet connection or a habit of leaving. In reality, the odds of you having a leaver on your team would be calculated by each player's individual leaving percentage times the 1/12 chance they will be placed on your team versus another. (Added together to make a full team of course.)This, by the by, is likely to change based on the rank you're in, what server you are playing in, and other factors. TL;DR: No. It isn't.

There are literally hundreds upon thousands of variables to consider at the end of the day. Ending the story at, ""you are not going to leave, so that means they might be more likely to leave"" is erroneous af.Beyond that, let us go into the delusional mind of a Junkrat main and for one second pretend that this drivel is actually objective fact. In this fantasy land where 2 + 2 = 6 and this guy confirmed the math, so it must be true, leavers are more likely on the enemy team. And that leaves us with a big so what? Who cares? That is not going to make me feel better when my wins and losses are invalidated because someone left. Free win, free loss, it does not matter.

I actually treat her more as a tank (controlling space, drawing aggro, etc.) I do think becoming an anti flanker is something that would help her a lot. I think overall Mei is in a difficult place, not because she is UP. But because she inconsistent. There is a big thread that details a lot of these inconsistencies. But in terms of her anti-flanking potential, I think a less development intensive way to address the issue is to make her slow debuff kick in earlier and last longer. As it stands most heroes once you get into range with them, they are easily frozen. Getting in range and surviving the enemy team is the difficult part.

"2555","Mei main here... once in a blue moon! Twice with ult. I screencap everytime this happens, I actually might just start making a folder of frozen tracers. (Or just tracer suffering)When it comes to tracer, I'm obviously relying on my icicle. As I've honed my aim well, I tend to atleast body shot them and force a recall. The really, really good tracers (the gm and top 500 ones I'm currently facing) I've just started playing against... yeah I'm struggling hitting them with MCREE (my other main) lmao.Good tracers are scary, and Mei is inconsistent for tracer even if you've greatly honed your aim. Some games I never hit tracer, while others I'm always headshotting them! They usually switch to pharah and focus me, I still shoot them down tho.Now, as for buffs, people have the absolute wrong idea for Mei I feel. IN FACT most of these suggestions come from people who dont even play Mei or realize her true role, or why Mei isnt the most ideal pick.As buzzinate pointed out, mobility skills should be reduced in terms of speed and distance, not completely removed that's basically hacking your enemy with primary fire. That would make Mei way too good, and then people will bandwagon her, yeah no thanks, don't want my Mei being a mustpick. I prefer the confined community that is being a Mei main. Now, Mei is weighed down due to the heavy gear she wears,  I understand that but I feel her speed could be increased just a bit, for QOL. Nothing major.  Really, Mei just needs minor-median QOL changes, nothing as severe as a rework please. A new ability maybe? Ultimate buffs definetly. Overall Mei just needs the small things, such as primary fire becoming hitscan (literally every other beam is). Icicles should stay the same besides an increased rate of fire. Cyrofreeze could be changed to stall less, but be more efficient such as providing a reload. I HATE people who pick Mei just to stall an inevitable loss, by the way her winrate is negatively impacted by this since people tend to go over that stat often.Mei doesn't need much to be in a better spot, people who suck as mei will still suck.

I can't say these words don't hurt, because they do. However, playing Mercy gives me passion. Some may not understand it; I don't exactly expect you to! Everyone is different and connects with varying heroes. ^^ So, let me just talk about Mercy before her re-work.Sure. Hiding wasn't as fun...and fighting a Mercy who just hid, flew in, revived everyone wasn't fun either. What was though, was the intensity to gather enough charge for revive, constantly feeling on edge, healing everyone, damage boosting every ability to get your ult quickly. It made healing more enjoyable. Sometimes, we got POTG too, not always, but sometimes. It was nice...for at least one shining moment a support's love and work for the team was shown.I used to hear in the voice comms wonderful comments whenever I pulled of a big revive, and if not, my heart gleamed with satisfaction whenever I chose correct to do a 1 man...or save for 3-5! However...the Mercy rework has come.The intentions were perfectly fine. Though, all in all...it wasn't done well. When she first got it, I admit fully that she was so broken. Instant revive...then Valkyrie with it resetting, then on 10 second cd? Insane it felt! Then, they nerfed her...and nerfed her...to the state she is now in.I have not played Overwatch in a few weeks, for my lovely hero who I felt a connection with had changed, and my bond with her was then tearing apart. The slow revive...it is not fun. It really isn't. It feels like a drag to revive someone, and usually you can only do it when the enemy team is nearly all dead. Her ultimate...I feel as though I need to get it quickly, as before! However...I don't look forward to it as I used to. I know that I can do plenty with it...but it just doesn't feel fun. It's hard to hit her flying around...her GA is so far...her beam range just isn't Mercy. Then soaring in the revive comrades who have fallen on the ground in combat, up to only 2, then flying back up. Sounds incredible...but doing it is lackluster. There is no adrenaline. There is no smile adorning my face. It feels like I am just a bot now...as though the names I was called before were true. Now...when I look at the big picture, people still think Mercy is the best support. She was fine for what..2 years? 3? with her 5 man revive (at max). Now being able to revive only one every 30 seconds...having to stand still for nearly 2 which makes one an easy target...that is op as well? My eyes turn to the side when I play her. I don't get enjoyment as I used to. I look towards other heroes because it's not fun to play Mercy. I have had a love for supporting people...healing, reviving them, boosting damage, and being able to fly...those are all incredible. And for those wonderful gifts to feel no longer pleasent to fight with is a true shame.She was the reason I bought Overwatch...I guess she's also the reason I am now drifting away.TLDR; New Mercy is no longer fun.

"2669","Hey everyone! So since Mercy's rework, i feel like she has become way too relevant, which has lead to some serious nerfs. I feel like after 300 hours of Mercy (both non-reworked and reworked) that Blizzard could have went with a different approach to Mercy instead of Valkyrie. So here's a list of changes i think is still not too late to do as some people isn't pleased with Valkyrie. I would love to hear people's opinions on this! Anyway, here we go;• Change Valkyrie back to old Ressurrect  - Keep new mercy GA ""angel jump"" - Give res a resource meter   - When mercy gets her ult, the resource meter will be at 5 ( max charge; indicates how many resses)This will make it possible to res your whole team within the time frameWithin 5 seconds, the resource meter depletes to 0 instantly. From there you can increase the charge by healing / damage boosting / doing damage / selfhealing. Table for charge needed for various res charges: 1 man res: 100 charge 2 man res: 200 charges3 man res: 300 charges4 man res: 400 charges5 man res: 500 chargesNow, obviously these numbers can change to range from 10 to 1000, completely up to Blizzard.Now you might ask about the whole ""hide and res"" ordeal which is what made Blizzard rework Mercy in the first place. Here's the idea; after 6 - 7 seconds of doing nothing (or hiding) the resource meter starts depleting very quickly (I feel like after 9 seconds the resource meter should be completely empty. Just like Moira's Biotic Energy lasts 9 seconds at full charge). This will prevent the ""hide and seek"" methods which every Mercy player used. When the meter starts depleting, you can still use Res from where the rate is. For example;If you're at charge 4 and the meter starts depleting to 3, if you Res before the charge hits 3, you will res 4 teammates. Now, any number or mechanic here can be changed to suit Blizzards taste, this is just a start.",0.666666666666667,"FALSE"

"2673","So we've only 3 characters the use Melee to deal most of their damage... Rien, Winston and Genji with their respective ults. I think we should get another! And I've got an idea! The idea for the kit would work like this:The primary would be some type of melee projectile, like a disk or glave that can bounce off of enemies and surfaces. Since not very many of the cast shoot actual solids (Torb and Genji are examples) I'm torn between whether it can be deflected or absorbed like those or be an actual melee weapon and cannot. I'm not sure about a secondary fire, as I planned for the disk to be charged like Hanzo to shoot it faster and do more damage. The first ability would be like a scatter arrow but act more like an explosion and would do all it's damage at once instead of separate fragments bouncing around.  10 second reload maybe? The second ability would be either a piercing shot or a shocking disk that slows and denies ability use for a second or two. The ult would be activated like the Supercharger. They place down a device that prevents critical hits to their teammates until a certain amount of damage is absorbed and then becomes inactive. It blocks the extra damage taken after the critical multiplier and ideally would show it's affected targets the amount of damage left over to be absorbed. I'm not sure what the ideal lockon distance would be but it certainly respects LoS and breaks after 1 second when you can't see it.

Wraithing into a teleport or teleporting into a wraith is really clunky and usually a suicide when escaping or entering combat.I think we all know the biggest issue is ShadowStep. It's only used well to escape spawn and a very wide flank (like gaps on Hanamura or Volskaya)It has its uses, but abilities that don't work in a fight are just bad.Shadowstep is counter-intuitive for Reaper. It's the only ability that doesn't give you an advantage when you're already fighting.Honestly I think Shadowstep and Wraith need reworks. While Reaper is in a niche state and is considered the ""highest F tier"" I don't want him buffed to Junkrat levels.So what could we do? Remove Shadowstep and give Wraith slight vertical movement, like a short Pharah hover or a Wallclimb. Not anything absurdThen what would Reaper's other ability be? Smoke BombsThey would probably be binded to Alt-Fire to feel more natural.Smoke bombs would work perfectly. He can throw them and wraith away for a better escape rather than risking a teleport.The only OP scenario I can picture is SmokeBombing a Graviton Surge.But other than that, it wouldn't be too absurd to fight. Even if Reaper wanted to death blossom into smoke, everyone already wants to escape the smoke so running from beyblade isn't too big of an issue.Here's what I'm proposing:ShadowBombsReaper stops shooting, and quickly shoots 4 smoke bombs from his guns.Like Junkrat bombs, but heavier so they have less range. Start smoking on impact with a: shield, barrier, wall, or floor-Fired 2 at a time, rapid burst so you can't make huge smoke walls-Around a 12 second cooldown, maybe higher-Each bomb has a small radius, around 2-4 meters-Last around 4 seconds, just enough for a quick getaway or an entryWhile I have extemely high doubts of this ever being ingame.

Id say 15% spread reduction will do since she can still do good dmg. We don't really need her to be a Tank buster on poor Zarya.For stealth, you are completely wrong. It not just lets you run fast, but you can stall an objective for a bit with people not noticing and you can pick off supports easily. (Especially Zenyatta!) Her having a delay isnt a bad thing and her having no delay was a bit too strong since it allowed her to assassinate healers without a trail. Yes she should be stealthy, be hard to track and assassinate easily. But she shouldn't have no counterplay or way of to be predicted.For your last argument: when a hero has an ult and is hacked, everyone can see it clear as day. Plus, you should be calling it out either way since Sombra is meant to be an enabler character. She's a cross of support and flanker making her unique. But in the end, she is a form of support by her kit's design and requires coordination and calling out. You shouldn't have your team see it so easily that you don't have to tell them your plan. Sombra shouldn't be a solo carry hero and should never be buffed to be one. She carries the weight of your team, not the match. You give your team an easy game and open opportunities for them. If you think Sombra should be played for a solo carry environment, then you don't understand her design and play her wrong or ask for too much. Aside from that, you have a few good points and I do believe Sombra needs a few buffs. But the kind to make her a better enabler, not the kind to make her the new Tracer.",0,"FALSE"

We can do this by the following:1) Reduce spread so her DPS is more reliable2) Get a Hack reset every time she kills someone so she can Hack more often3) Stealth should become a resource meter to overall improve on consistency (not 100% on this)4) Every ability Sombra has SHOULD NOT have a delay5) Sugar Skulls on hacked enemies would make the world go round for Sombra6) Fix ALL SEVEN bugs that Sombra has so she can be at least functional",-0.4,"TRUE"

"2881","Posted by WhateverAlexPosted by Widowmaker...With the old mercy, her pickrate is significantly lower than the current one (with Valkyrie)If you didn't pay attention at all, but the top healers for dive meta at the time was lucio and zen, not Mercy. Mercy might have a high pickrate at lower elo, but she is still manageable. Just revert Mercy back before her rework and you'll see her pickrate drop down. I feel like people forget what happened like 1 season ago. Mercy wasn't always 100% essential and I don't know why people exxagerate it as much. Yes, she rose but that was mainly because of Ana's nerf. With the addition of Moira and the buff back to Ana, 1.0 Mercy if brought back won't be nearly as much as an issue as this Mercy is now or even if she was an issue originally. There are better healers, she isn't 1 of 2 now and with the more variety in kit from Ana and Moira, it will really show.Me thinks that people over exaggerate her pick rates before rework, because she was picked the most of all healers 1-2 seasons ago.She was picked the most, and you'd usually run into the multiple ""Mercy OTP in a match"" issue, but no way in hell she was a must pick across all ranks. Maybe at lower ranks where players depended more on ults to win fights, since old rez could counter every ultimate the enemy could throw at you only if it was used at the last moment. Mass Rez was crazy, and Mercy eventually started to powercreep her way to high ranks thanks to the invulnerability buff letting Rez be used as an escape mechanism and as a method to force the pace of the match with tempo rezzes, but Ana, Lucio and Zen were also crazy.",0.28,"FALSE"
"2882","heres a thought i had.the main reason why hide and res was so prevalent, was because it was a super easy way to exploit the sr system and gaining more points then you should and losing less.obviously this system is based on hero averages, so unless its specified by blizz (which imo would make it an even worst system than it seems) on what is the avergae then eventually the average ress amount would be raised and it would less and less worthwhile to hide and ress until it reaches normality with normal mercy players. people wont climb anymore getting into ranks they ""dont deserve"", people switch to different hero to exploit the system, or a character they know how to play and do it the hard way.eventually the average will drop by then but with the new non performance system from diamond and up this exploit is no longer as bad as a problem it was, meaning most of the reason behind hide res is gone and players will would of had to learn how to play mercy at diamond level, which btw she was porbaly in the bottom half of popular character or at least around there at those levels of play.",0.0588235294117647,"FALSE"
"2883","I don't understand how everyone is just conveniently forgetting about the months and months and months where Mercy was practically useless and largely considered a burden to have on the team. Rez was suicide 90% of the time before invulnerability was added in February. It was finally ""acceptable"" to play Mercy, because her ult was no longer a death sentence. She wasn't considered viable up until that point, and after becoming viable, no one complained about her. No one complained about ""hide and rez"", either.Even with her invuln, Ana and Lucio (or was it Zenyatta?) were still favored over Mercy. Pre-rework Mercy wasn't overpowered and the myth that most Mercy players hid and rezzed was a nonproblem at best. I think the biggest reason she became a nuisance to some is because she could acquire her ult unreasonably fast for how powerful it was (and it was powerful to compensate for her kit.) It also doesn't help that the other healers have had their healing nerfed in one way or another, making Mercy's healing seem disproportionate in comparison (although I'd argue that a dedicated healer should do more healing).I just want the community to stop perpetuating the lie that Mercy has always been overpowered, viable, and a must pick.

I'm not helping to set up the play, I'm just sitting back and playing ""Health Bar: The Game"" while everyone else is playing Overwatch. To top it off, if you even catch a glimpse of a Tracer, Genji or Reaper it is time find another teammate and fly to them to have you protect them.I felt like I was a healbot that my team had to keep safe, not an actual participant.Good points!  Some players like the more reactive plays than proactive and I think the support category is designed for them.  In this case, Ana may be the support for you.",0.846153846153846,"FALSE"

"2951","Her mobility is number one for me. I still enjoyed 1.0 Mercy, even without the little GA hop, mainly because of how satisfying it felt to be able to sustain a team. The big rezzes were really fun, but I still enjoy 2.0's single rezzes because it can still be game-changing depending on who you rez.But the GA hop has to be my favorite thing about her. I first got into Ana as a healer when I got the game but found it difficult to keep up with high mobility teammates, so I tried out Mercy and here we are!Also, I just really love the Angel aesthetic.",0.8,"FALSE"
"2952","High mobility, very consistent healing.  It's why other healers will never measure up.I would be absolutely disappointed if they nerfed her mobility in any way.  I'm not attached to rez nor have I ever been, so I kinda don't care what happens to it.",0,"FALSE"
"2953","Honestly, because she's harder to kill than Ana is by a huge margin. Better survivability equates to better healing. If somehow they give Ana stronger options to deal with the Tracers, Genji's, Sombra's and Doomfists of the world then I'll go back to playing her. Until then I will ALWAYS think that Mercy is the better support healer. For me at least it has little to nothing to do about resurrections. I just hate dying.",0.333333333333333,"FALSE"

"2956","The movement is what I find so fun, too. I love slingshotting around the map, skip-jumping between allies and topping them off as I go. When the last rez nerf hit, I argued that I'd rather they remove rez as a non-ult ability entirely rather than slow me down while using it. I hate that slow, I hate being stuck in one place. I want to be flying constantly. I'd rather have a less powerful E ability that doesn't require a slow + cast time + long cooldown to be balanced, so long as I get to keep high mobility.",-0.2,"TRUE"

"2959","I'm not quite sure if that's already in-the game because it would just make sense to me. It would be great, if we'd get XP based on how long we were On-Fire or how much On-Fire ""Points"" we got. I think that's a really nice way to let players engage more in the battle with all sorts of things that you get these points for (blocking, healing, etc). Of course this rule should only apply to competetive games, so you can't cheat yourself XP. :)",0.333333333333333,"FALSE"

Makes arcade much more fun and less chore like.But people keep saying ""it will cause bad behaivor!""Guys, have ya seen how toxic as absolute hell people get in arcade when trying to get lootboxes? Do you know how many people quit mid-round because they realize its a landslide loss so they're just wasting their time and decide to quit and requeue for a new round? Do you know how much of a fun sponge the win requirement is?Contrary to popular belief, I'm sure if you make it games played not everyone and their dog is just going to literally sit AFK in spawn the entire round. There will be a small minority of throwers who do, but the benefits massively out way the costs and the report feature is there for a reason.",0,"FALSE"

"2975","She was already in need of buffs to her utility, before Moira came out. When she did, it really took a toll on her. Almost half the roster counters her, now she has another Hero who can easily deal with her. Moira’s orbs and her long reach with her Biotic Grasp counters her in every way, all she has to do is keep her distance since her Biotic Grasp has triple the range and use her orbs to destroy her turrets.Aside from Moira... Pharah, Winston, Mccree, Mei, Reaper, Junkrat, Roadhog, D va, Tracer, and Torbjorn all counter her well. Improving her utility and survivability would help her a lot. Especially since they’re many other heroes who can do her job much better than she can. She isn’t even that helpful as a support, and I’m not saying that because she can’t heal. The fact is she isn’t very supportive to her team, only her ultimates are somewhat supportive.Let’s keep this up til we get Dev feedback. :)",0.6,"FALSE"

"2979","If you described it as a preferred role select system it wouldve been a bit better. Not everyone likes playing every tank, dps, healer, etc. So if someone were to play with a Healer selection but they only play mercy but mercy is taken what are they going to do if they don't know how to play any other healer, If defined as a role select system it could be that they don't have to ability to play any other role so their basically useless for their team if they cant convince the other player to trade.Also this would lead to longer queue times and worse team compositions, Because what happens when one of your players leave, Its either going to have to fill that role which means your not going to have a player for a longer time than usual or its going to give you a DPS to fill your healer role.Defining this role selection whatsoever could help a lot though, because your just calling it by a name with little meaning. It would either Enforce 2-2-2 or be more like a preferred role system where you could select a role you would like to play and possibly one that your okay with player, and maybe even one you definitely cannot play or will not play. There's also the issue still of how your going to match these players together because its either 2-2-2 for the preferred roles or player defined as to what else they would like on their team, With 2-2-2 it would most likely end up with longer queue times, Which would be pointless to add to ""Quick Play"" if your just going to increase Queue times. The best thing you could do for a system like this is go to a 3rd party website or something like that, that will help you join a team of players willing to fill those roles along with you then you can 6 stack matches with these roles, all done by the community.Other than that they don't intend to shift the meta, ideally it would be best for every hero to have a counter, to counter someone, and be equal to most other heroes, but at the current state of the game and basically every past state you shouldn't be trying to win alone, you should be communicating with your team and to out play the enemies and win, but this is all optional.",0.478260869565217,"FALSE"
"2980","Nearly everyone on Overwatch wants a Role Select system. When asked about it, Blizzard states they won't do it because they don't want to force a meta. If you think about it though, Blizzard has been adjusting metas since Overwatch's release.For example, ask yourself these questions. Is it a coincidence that Ana, Lucio, D.Va, and Reignhart received nerfs during the triple tank era? Is it a coincidence that Zarya got her graviton buff during the dive meta? Is it a coincidence that Mercy got buffed when her play time was at all time low in high tiers?If you think reasonably, no.

"2986","I can see where you are coming from with many of your points but I have to disagree. I'm not sure what you mean by "" CSGO Mechanics"" 4:3 streched isn't a ""CSGO Thing"" most games support these streched aspect ratios such as R6S. As to the implication that the streched aspect ratio makes it easier to hit targets I find that isn't really true it does enlargen everything horizontally, this however is only more visual as lowering your fov will also make the targets ""larger"". Also it's not a matter if how many people use 4:3 as I use this on a 16:9 Monitor ( I just prefer this streched aspect ratio ). Also the same principle in this change applies to 21:9 Monitors.",0.2,"FALSE"
"2987","Its not CSGO. CSGO mechanics dont work in overwatch, so stop applying CSGO mentality to games that arent CSGO. As such, the overwhelming majority of gamers are beyond 4:3 these days, its even difficult to find a monitor with that specific ratio. Not that I dont completely disagree with you; but there is obviously a reason they wont/dont do this.Here's some things to consider 1) aspect ratios will change, possibly giving you an unfair advantage2) stretched hit boxes might give you an unfair advantage3) FOV might be a hinderance, giving the other player an unfair advantage? 4) 4:3 is outdated my dude... no bones about this one. 5) how many people are using 4:3?

"2988","Why is there no 4:3 Resolution Support in Overwatch? Coming from CSGO I find it difficult to adjust ( As I normally play 1024 X 768 (streched) ). No, the answer is not 4:3 is an outdated aspect ratio. Even so, that doesn't mean it shouldn't be supported. I don't know about evryone else but I can only see benefits in adding support for 4:3 as well as 21:9. The only downside I can see is. Blizzard having to delegate some resources to this instead of new content. Even then, this should've been supported from the beginning. In conclusion, I think Blizzard needs to clarify wether this is an issue with the engine of Overwatch(idk I'm not a dev) or wether the support for these resolutions will come.",0.4,"FALSE"

This makes a huge difference.  If every frame is that much smaller (in resolution) it's much easier for a system under strain to make more of them, faster.

"11184","That's just natural :P We all start somewhere so don't stress about it too much. Try out all the different heroes so you at least get a feel for what their kits do. After that, see which ones you like and focus on them. Most of the skills you need for overwatch will just naturally come with time and experience. Try to hone your general awareness, whether that be listening to what's going on around you, what threats are present, looking at the kill feed to see how your team is faring, what ults your team has up, what ults the enemy team might have up, etc. Having good awareness will lead to having good game sense.Always try to play the objective, the objective is the number one priority and it is also what many newer players neglect. Learn how to analyse the objective timer as it can be confusing to understand for beginners. For example, overtime will start to tick if you guys are on 99% and the other team is on 0 but still contesting. Whilst your gut reaction may be to panic and try to touch point - that is often the wrong decision. Instead, realise that your team only needs 1% more and it is ok to let the enemy cap the point in order to regroup as a team and push together. On the flip side, recognise which overtimes mean TOUCH the point and STAY on the point using whatever means possible. It is all too common to pull a c9 - meaning that a team has the opportunity to contest the point but don't do so and lose the game. If you notice that your team is pushed all the way up but the point hasn't been capped, sit on the point and cap it yourself. If you notice there is nobody on payload, let your team know or sit on it yourself. Trickling is BAD. Don't trickle, don't let your team trickle, spam that group up button when you notice people are just going onto the point one by one and dying.

"11555","Hi all, I'm the author of this guide. I had originally written it for /r/overwatchuniversity (but had also always intended for /u/vandalmunroe to use it for his website) and people there were saying that 'communication is a net negative,' so I wrote a 'small' edit to my original post. I'll copy it here in case anyone wants to read that as well. In the comments, some people have been saying that they have felt that communicating only tends to tilt people. This can be because of a variety of things. Those people could have already been tilted and are venting their frustrations on the 'tryhard' (shouldn't we all be tryharding in competitive?) for example. It could also be that the player who is communicating is being too condescending or argumentative about it (often without realizing it) even though they do mean well. Then there is also the fact that some people are just playing their own game and have next to zero interest in actually working with their team, which (to me) is entirely the wrong way of going about a competitive OW game.If you queue up in competitive (which is by all accounts the most 'serious' way of playing the game for most players) in Overwatch, which is a multiplayer only team based game, I think that there should be a certain willingness to be a team player and work with your team. I am not saying that people should be playing heroes they really don't want to play or have no playtime on and be the lackey of their team, but there is a middle ground between that and blatantly ignoring the input of your team and just doing whatever the hell you want, including getting mad when someone does want to work as a team. This is partially covered in the 'mind your attitude' part of the guide though.Either way: it is important to get a feel for your team. If a certain player really doesn't handle your suggestion to switch off well then it's probably best to leave it at that, for example. Millions of people play this game and as such there's tons of different personality types behind those screens. Much as in real life it's important that you are able to 'read the room'.It is also possible to 'force yourself' on your team too hard. It is fine to communicate regular stuff (basic health callouts, ults, ...) but if you try to babysit your team a little too hard then there's a possibility that that doesn't sit well with the enemy team. Remember that no one elected you as their leader, so it's not your responsibility to steer the team and have all of them play to your ideas. If you are calling the shots a bit and people are listening and agreeing, then great, keep doing that. But if you feel like your team wants to go a different route then go along with the team. It's a team game, there is no set hierarchy, you're all on the same level of the leadership pyramid.There is also definitely the possibility that you are communicating too much. As with almost anything, moderation is key. There's no need to call out that McCree used his roll when he exited spawn, or that Tracer used one blink, for example. Aside from that, some groups of people naturally prefer a more laid back style of comms (just saying whatever is really necessary) whilst some will have no problem with a more 'professional' style of communication. Again; reading the room is important.Edit conclusionI don't want to pull any rank card or sound like a grandpa, but I've been playing competitive games for the better part of a decade now and communication is something which leads to good results (or at least causes no extra troubles) 95% of the time in my opinion. It's definitely very important to 'read the room' when you're playing with randoms though, and that is a skill that will come with time. Some people are 'beyond help' (people who are already tilted from a loss streak, very selfish/arrogant players, trolls, ...) but that's just the nature of people, that's not a downside of communicating in itself.It is important to also look at yourself as well. If you find that more than half of your teammates get angry with you after a while then it's probably best to take a look at how exactly you're communicating. No matter how well you mean it, you could be coming off as a smug bastard to them or you could be yelling stuff which really doesn't matter at all.All in all I firmly believe that being able to communicate properly (which also means knowing what you can and can't say to certain teammates and so on) is a very valuable skill. You don't have to be talking all the time (I don't do that either) and as with everything there are nuances to it. You're playing with real people with real feelings and personalities after all, not with robots. Some people prefer to be silent and just listen in and that's fine as well, but I wholeheartedly disagree with the notion that getting on comms somehow always (or the majority of the time) has a negative effect on your team. That doesn't rhyme with my experiences and it doesn't rhyme with what I see on the streams I watch every day either.",0.233333333333333,"FALSE"

Not to be egotistic myself but I have good game sense and understand game mechanics and play well. Am I good? that's another question.and the only reason I did start doing this is because I read a top post on here the other day that leaving voice chat helps you have a better game due to the cut off from the chatter.P.S what also doesn't help is that I play off meta heros. so people assume i'm throwing.",0.272727272727273,"FALSE"
"11558","I am not against people who don't talk themselves. I'm of the opinion that it's always better to at least make super necessary callouts (like a flanking Reaper with ult or whatever who hasn't been seen by anyone in your team) but I understand that there are people who'd rather not talk due to a variety of reasons. Completely shutting off the chat of other people by default is something which I think is rather silly though. Initially it might help you to focus on your game if you just turn everything off, but remember that OW is a team game and you team's input can genuinely mean the difference between winning or losing a game.I also think that being able to listen to team chat whilst playing the game is a skill which needs to be trained before you can do it perfectly. If it's really so beneficial to just mute everything then why don't pro teams do that, for instance? Another comment on here went something along the lines of 'how is communicating with my team gonna help me win a 1v1 with a flanker' and the answer is that it won't help you win that 1v1 in that instance (though communicating it may save your life due to someone peeling for you or whatever) but to me that's a bit of a lazy (I don't mean that offensively) way of thinking. For example; I play soccer. Why would I try to look up at the field as often as possible when running with the bal when I can just look at my feet the entire team, making it way easier? This just to say that, yes, it might be easier to look at your feet, but you'll lose valuable info on the position of your teammates and the opposition. Once you've practiced enough it becomes second nature to look up as much as possible as opposed to looking at your feet.The same goes for OW. Yeah, it might be easier to shut everything off and 'just focus on your own play' but that comes at the cost of not hearing possible gamesaving calls, not being able to call out very important stuff which can win you games, ... I've been gaming for a long time and now I can easily talk and listen to other players without it being a major hindrance to me. You can look at players like Emongg if you want an example of a player who is constantly talking and listening and still performing very well. Now of course if your team consists of a bunch of trolls blaring music and farting noises through their mics whilst raging at each other then you can turn it all off, but I think shutting off communications entirely by default isn't the right way to go. TL;DR: I'd say shutting off all comms by default is a mistake. It might be easier for you to play without all of these 'distractions' but once you get used to it it's not a distraction any longer. Perhaps a silly example to illustrate my point: it's easier to ride a bike with training wheels because you're not being distracted by the whole 'trying to stay upright' thing, but if you want to become a decent/pro cyclist you're gonna have to take off the training wheels sooner or later.",0.314285714285714,"FALSE"

Probably my funnest games I have ever played in comp.Before the rounds I seen we went the basic 2/2/2 comp right off the bat which was great!! So I told the flanker to flank the team and the rest stick together behind our Rein and they all said ""understood"" with the quick msgs.Then when we started I made all the callouts of the enemy flankers and my tanks helped me out Rein saved me several times.

If your Mercy blatantly missed your multiple calls for healing and you were standing right next to her then you have every right to be a little upset, but don't let it shine through in your comms too much. It's okay to tell someone you think they did something wrong (and you should be able to take constructive criticism as a player in a competitive game mode) but never resort to flaming or any sort of abuse. There are people who are able to shrug stuff like that off, but mostly you will only generate an equally hostile response or cause people to start playing worse (i.e. 'tilting' them) and that is the shortest way to a loss.This is the most important piece of advice out the entire post.

It's very difficult to track where people are when I uppercut two of them under a bridge and get bounced around and shit, and his CD's are so fast I often forget that his punch just came back up.
