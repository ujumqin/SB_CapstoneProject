They just go a set distance regardless of enemies with slows. Imagine if Tracer couldn't Blink as far if Mei was freezing her. Imagine if Orisa's Halt would limit the length of Genji's Swift Strike. Mobility is so strong because the heroes that are designed to limit mobility don't actually limit it. Plain and simple, a slow should reduce the length of a dash or the force of a leap proportional to the strength of the slow. This would be a buff to Orisa, Mei, and Symmetra, allowing them to hold mobile heroes in place and reduce the impact of their mobility."

Considering how long we on Console have been effectively shafted though, this was the best option I could think of.[Warning: Wall of text incoming.]If it was planned, from day one, to release the game on both PC and Console, then why are the concerns of the Console player base not being addressed, or at the very least, acknowledged? We had no choice but to buy the game for $60 (we didn't have an option of being able to buy the game for just $40 like PC does). This means that we are having to spend more just to be able to even get the game to begin with.Furthermore, we not only had to wait 15 months for a report system, but said system is super abusable. If you guys on PC think that the report system and automated bans is rough, allow me to enlighten you: it's even WORSE on Console. If we file a ticket with Blizzard as a result of a ban in-game on Console, we will be told that the Consoles have separate systems that Blizzard can't access, and will thus be told to file a ticket with Microsoft/Sony. If we file a ticket with Microsoft/Sony, they state that they don't handle in-game bans, only gamer-tag bans. This means that neither party knows anything with regards to Console in-game bans. Why are we being told to file a ticket with Microsoft or Sony, even though they've already stated that they do NOT handle in-game bans? Something has to be known from this so we can at least HAVE a chance to be able to appeal our in-game bans. Proof: https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759446940 Thread made by someone who plays on Console who has had to deal with this very thingThen, there's the 30+ things that we on Console lack (some of which are already on the PC version), and the extreme most part of those things which can quite easily be implemented. If all feedback is welcome, then why is our feedback not being addressed, much less acknowledged? Why are threads asking about when new cosmetics are coming being addressed, but not our consolidated feedback thread with regards to Console issues? A thread by the way, that has been going strong for over 4 months and counting. If elaboration on this is further needed, then I direct you to this thread here: https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20758447090?page=1EDIT (this was added on 12-19-17): Heck, there's not even an end-game for us. Competitive for us on Console really does not mean jack simply because there is no end-game. There's no OWL, Contenders, Open Division, heck; there's not even a single tournament that we on Console can even get that's hosted, much less sponsored, by Blizzard. Before anyone mentions it, yes I get that Blizzard has always been more of a PC developer than a Console one. However, they released the game on all platforms, and even had planned to do so from the very beginning. Therefore, this same care that Blizzard gives to PC, needs to be given to Console as well. Say someone on our platform reaches Top 500 and really wants to play in things like Open Division; what would happen? Would that person be forced to move over to PC just to have a chance? Simple little standard things like this really press home the second class citizen vibe that we console players receive. With all this said, can we at least get an update on when our current issues will be addressed please? We don't want our player-base to fade away completely because our feedback is not being listened to. The game started out very strong with the platform support, but now it feels like it just got dropped. I'm simply asking that we actually GET the value of the money that we spent on the game.If you read all the way up to this point, then you have no idea how much I appreciate this, because it shows that you really do care.Just to reiterate this again: I do apologize if this is the wrong way to go about this. We on Console have been shafted for too long now, and this was simply the best option I could think of to give our concerns.16 pages in now, and 3 weeks later...UPDATES:The ability for crouch to not be restricted to just toggle: https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760716093#post-13Ally aim assist for Ana: https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759487829?page=2#post-35"

With that time, maybe you can work to afford yourself some more video games?[Warning: Wall of text incoming.]Keep in mind: I didn't make this thread to hear PC Elitists mock us (I'm not looking at the 'hur dur PC Master Race' posts here (you know what I'm implying); I'm looking at those posts that relate to ""Buy a PC you Console Peasant/2nd class citizen"", etc.). I made this thread to let our voices with regards to our platform of the game be heard.Consoles have more convenience in them, and the vast majority of us have friends that play on Console, not on PC. We're not blind in this community. Look at threads that get a reply from devs in this forum (not to be confused with mods here). How many of those threads are PC related, and something small (i.e. when new cosmetics are coming)? Sure, it's not many, but it still has the better reply chance. Now look at the other end: the threads that are Console related, and something well researched/documented. How many of these kinds of threads get a reply from devs? Practically none.To answer your last bit: yes I already do have a job. The reason why I don't go and buy more games is because:1. It's made by a company who is known to have greedy business practices (I'm looking at you EA, main Activision (so as not to be confused with Blizzard Entertainment), and Ubisoft, to name a few). 2. Overwatch is still better than quite a lot of games that were made even this year (even despite what it lacks on Console). If I come off as somebody who sounds easily tilted, that may very much be the case (I won't deny it). However, not only did we still pay for the game, but a good chunk of the things that we've been wanting/needing, we've been asking since launch (that's almost 19 months ago now). We still are as passionate as you guys on PC are about this game. We aren't even asking for a lot with threads like this one, and Biv's (linked in OP), to name a couple. We don't even get something as simple as ""Hey guys, we hear you loud and clear!"" on these forums, even despite all of our concerns. Yet, there's threads that ask when new cosmetics are coming that get answered within a few hours, and in some cases, even as little as 15 minutes. Look at how long we had to wait for our Report System (and this is just to name one example). We didn't even get a reply about when our Report System would be coming until 8 months after the game launched (this was when they hoped to have it in during, or even before summer, you see). When we had asked for an update in July, we get the response of ""Soon™"" (again, you know what I'm implying). Now you have 14 months past launch and it's still not in the Console version of the game. The Report Feature was not enabled for us until the 1.14 patch, which released on August 28th. That's 15 months gone that we've had to deal with being unable to report glitchers, throwers, etc.. I'm not going to so much use the term cheaters in this bit; a vast majority of the cheating that had occurred on Console were people glitching into walls to be able to prevent point caps making it impossible for the attacking team to cap their objective. So we had people that could get away with literally anything and everything and we wouldn't be able to do anything about it.You also can't justify the excuse of ""It's because of Sony/Microsoft"" either. Games that have been available on Console have already had a Report System available on day 1. Heck, Fortnite is still in beta, and it already has a Report System. Hope I've cleared up some of our situation to you. Apologies if I've sounded critical on some parts. As I stated though, we are still passionate about this game just as much as you guys are.What are you not getting?!?I was not talking to you. My post was to someone else. I think i made that clear on my previous post. You just got offended because I gave someone a christmas solution and your butthurt about it.  since you dont want to switch and that is fine.

Rien, Winston and Genji with their respective ults. I think we should get another! And I've got an idea! The idea for the kit would work like this:The primary would be some type of melee projectile, like a disk or glave that can bounce off of enemies and surfaces. Since not very many of the cast shoot actual solids (Torb and Genji are examples) I'm torn between whether it can be deflected or absorbed like those or be an actual melee weapon and cannot. I'm not sure about a secondary fire, as I planned for the disk to be charged like Hanzo to shoot it faster and do more damage. The first ability would be like a scatter arrow but act more like an explosion and would do all it's damage at once instead of separate fragments bouncing around.  10 second reload maybe? The second ability would be either a piercing shot or a shocking disk that slows and denies ability use for a second or two. The ult would be activated like the Supercharger. They place down a device that prevents critical hits to their teammates until a certain amount of damage is absorbed and then becomes inactive. It blocks the extra damage taken after the critical multiplier and ideally would show it's affected targets the amount of damage left over to be absorbed. I'm not sure what the ideal lockon distance would be but it certainly respects LoS and breaks after 1 second when you can't see it. This definitely needs work and refinement but I would like to see your guy's thoughts and certainly a response from the Team."

Posted by BivOnce this hits 200 likes, there is no denying that they ignored us on purpose, they want us to know that they are unappreciative of console players, they just don't want us to have as good of an experience as PC players, for no clear reason.Posted by BivThis is stupid, Blizzard won't add things that PC has, to console, that are so simple, after this much. Blizzard is making me feel like I am supposed to be disappointed by them.Posted by BivBlizzard has no reason to ignore us like this, this is unacceptable. They don't treat us like part of the community, they treat us like we aren't important at all, they don't want our feedback, they don't want to hear what we have to say.Posted by BivI paid for the game, just like the PC players, we deserve equal treatment, I'm tired of Blizzard's neglect.Posted by Biv I forgot that it costs more on console, more reasons to think Blizzard hates console, and only put it there for money.Posted by Biv It would probably take them another year to add a single thing from the list, that's how much they hate console.Posted by Biv Blizzard thinks it's ok to neglect this part of the community.Posted by BivAre you scared to respond because it will bring attention, and you will have to do SOMETHING for this part of YOUR COMMUNITY, so that more people don't think that you NEGLECT this part of the community? I am sick of it, I payed for this FULL game, NOT to get a crappy ignored version of it, because I bought it on a platform that wasn't PC, give me the full game or give me my money back.Posted by BivWhen can I get my money back? The console version is only worth half of it's price.Posted by BivBlizzard this is disappointing, if you aren't replying, you should at least be working on like 10 of these things right now. They can't even REPLY, they want us to leave, they want us to think that they will neglect the community because they are lazy, and will remove stuff from a version of the game only to be inconvenient. It's not hard to reply, AT ALL, but they want us to know that they don't want us.Posted by Biv It's gonna hit 400 likes, and Blizzard won't do anything, they hate us, and it's pretty obvious.Posted by BivBlizzard needs to stop neglecting their community, or they will lose even more people, they have already lost me.I wouldn't be surprised, if they ignore this, because of you."

And we have lots and lots of support mains in here as well. A mobility hero which is SPECIFICALLY designed to target the backline and kill the supports? Guess what their reactions will be. Deflect hitboxes and fast movements and every other argument they bring up is just an excuse to request for either a hard counter that takes little to no effort but destroys genji, or to remove genji from competitive play.I've seen countless posts of people with 5 minutes of genji play in TOTAL, claiming that he's too easy to contribute with and to win. a lot of players never play him, yet consider him an EASY character to play which rewards you heavily. Like i said. The reason isn't logical.I don't want to lump myself with these kinds of people. I'm a Support main and I know full well when I've been outplayed and when a kill/death is deserved. As a Support main, I am fully aware of everything around me at all times. The problem that I have with Genji, at least as a Lucio main, is that his Deflect hitbox is far too large. That alone is my only gripe with Genji. Full stop. If Genji becomes a problem to me, I can now swap to Moira to not only more effectively combat Genji, but also contribute to healing."

So since Mercy's rework, i feel like she has become way too relevant, which has lead to some serious nerfs. I feel like after 300 hours of Mercy (both non-reworked and reworked) that Blizzard could have went with a different approach to Mercy instead of Valkyrie. So here's a list of changes i think is still not too late to do as some people isn't pleased with Valkyrie. I would love to hear people's opinions on this! Anyway, here we go;• Change Valkyrie back to old Ressurrect  - Keep new mercy GA ""angel jump"" - Give res a resource meter   - When mercy gets her ult, the resource meter will be at 5 ( max charge; indicates how many resses)This will make it possible to res your whole team within the time frameWithin 5 seconds, the resource meter depletes to 0 instantly. From there you can increase the charge by healing / damage boosting / doing damage / selfhealing. Table for charge needed for various res charges: 1 man res: 100 charge 2 man res: 200 charges3 man res: 300 charges4 man res: 400 charges5 man res: 500 chargesNow, obviously these numbers can change to range from 10 to 1000, completely up to Blizzard.Now you might ask about the whole ""hide and res"" ordeal which is what made Blizzard rework Mercy in the first place. Here's the idea; after 6 - 7 seconds of doing nothing (or hiding) the resource meter starts depleting very quickly (I feel like after 9 seconds the resource meter should be completely empty. Just like Moira's Biotic Energy lasts 9 seconds at full charge). This will prevent the ""hide and seek"" methods which every Mercy player used. When the meter starts depleting, you can still use Res from where the rate is. For example;If you're at charge 4 and the meter starts depleting to 3, if you Res before the charge hits 3, you will res 4 teammates. Now, any number or mechanic here can be changed to suit Blizzards taste, this is just a start."

Wraithing into a teleport or teleporting into a wraith is really clunky and usually a suicide when escaping or entering combat.I think we all know the biggest issue is ShadowStep. It's only used well to escape spawn and a very wide flank (like gaps on Hanamura or Volskaya)It has its uses, but abilities that don't work in a fight are just bad.Shadowstep is counter-intuitive for Reaper. It's the only ability that doesn't give you an advantage when you're already fighting.Honestly I think Shadowstep and Wraith need reworks. While Reaper is in a niche state and is considered the ""highest F tier"" I don't want him buffed to Junkrat levels.So what could we do? Remove Shadowstep and give Wraith slight vertical movement, like a short Pharah hover or a Wallclimb. Not anything absurdThen what would Reaper's other ability be? Smoke BombsThey would probably be binded to Alt-Fire to feel more natural.Smoke bombs would work perfectly. He can throw them and wraith away for a better escape rather than risking a teleport.The only OP scenario I can picture is SmokeBombing a Graviton Surge.But other than that, it wouldn't be too absurd to fight. Even if Reaper wanted to death blossom into smoke, everyone already wants to escape the smoke so running from beyblade isn't too big of an issue.Here's what I'm proposing:ShadowBombsReaper stops shooting, and quickly shoots 4 smoke bombs from his guns.Like Junkrat bombs, but heavier so they have less range. Start smoking on impact with a: shield, barrier, wall, or floor-Fired 2 at a time, rapid burst so you can't make huge smoke walls-Around a 12 second cooldown, maybe higher-Each bomb has a small radius, around 2-4 meters-Last around 4 seconds, just enough for a quick getaway or an entryWhile I have extemely high doubts of this ever being ingame. I think it would work very well for Reaper and could even make him more interesting for normal gameplay and even esports.I hope the dev's consider a Reaper change soon"

Yeah, call me whatever you want.Skill-less. Brain dead. M1M1M1M1M1. Rez bot. Pathetic. Boosted. Yes. I can't say these words don't hurt, because they do. However, playing Mercy gives me passion. Some may not understand it; I don't exactly expect you to! Everyone is different and connects with varying heroes. ^^ So, let me just talk about Mercy before her re-work.Sure. Hiding wasn't as fun...and fighting a Mercy who just hid, flew in, revived everyone wasn't fun either. What was though, was the intensity to gather enough charge for revive, constantly feeling on edge, healing everyone, damage boosting every ability to get your ult quickly. It made healing more enjoyable. Sometimes, we got POTG too, not always, but sometimes. It was nice...for at least one shining moment a support's love and work for the team was shown.I used to hear in the voice comms wonderful comments whenever I pulled of a big revive, and if not, my heart gleamed with satisfaction whenever I chose correct to do a 1 man...or save for 3-5! However...the Mercy rework has come.The intentions were perfectly fine. Though, all in all...it wasn't done well. When she first got it, I admit fully that she was so broken. Instant revive...then Valkyrie with it resetting, then on 10 second cd? Insane it felt! Then, they nerfed her...and nerfed her...to the state she is now in.I have not played Overwatch in a few weeks, for my lovely hero who I felt a connection with had changed, and my bond with her was then tearing apart. The slow revive...it is not fun. It really isn't. It feels like a drag to revive someone, and usually you can only do it when the enemy team is nearly all dead. Her ultimate...I feel as though I need to get it quickly, as before! However...I don't look forward to it as I used to. I know that I can do plenty with it...but it just doesn't feel fun. It's hard to hit her flying around...her GA is so far...her beam range just isn't Mercy. Then soaring in the revive comrades who have fallen on the ground in combat, up to only 2, then flying back up. Sounds incredible...but doing it is lackluster. There is no adrenaline. There is no smile adorning my face. It feels like I am just a bot now...as though the names I was called before were true. Now...when I look at the big picture, people still think Mercy is the best support. She was fine for what..2 years? 3? with her 5 man revive (at max). Now being able to revive only one every 30 seconds...having to stand still for nearly 2 which makes one an easy target...that is op as well? My eyes turn to the side when I play her. I don't get enjoyment as I used to. I look towards other heroes because it's not fun to play Mercy. I have had a love for supporting people...healing, reviving them, boosting damage, and being able to fly...those are all incredible. And for those wonderful gifts to feel no longer pleasent to fight with is a true shame.She was the reason I bought Overwatch...I guess she's also the reason I am now drifting away.TLDR; New Mercy is no longer fun. She feels like broken scraps torn up."

It's so difficult to raise for Mercy and you have to do or gamble so much for it be active when you actively know you're putting in a ton of work. You have to rez consistently, damage boost assists over healing assists, and tag/kill enemies with your pistol.So how does that feel when the meter is said to indicate the impact you've had on the game and you might see it over 1/4 tops? Probably discouraging. It's always kind of been this way too, except for when? When Mercy would hide, pop off a huge Rez, and now she was on fire. Psychologically... it feels good. Honestly, if anyone says ""Mercy requires no skill"" just play a game and try to keep that meter even 1/4 filled through the entire game and your role as a healer. That alone takes miles of skill."

(I've also played this game a lot less, only played yesterday to get my decay back 3800 to 4000)Mass Rez really fit with her passive playstyle, ""hide to rez"" is such a glorified statement. It took a lot more thought than simply hiding. Analyzing when the enemy was going to use ults to back up, predicting where the team will die, calculating where the flankers will come from, and maintaining as much healing value as possible was so exhilarating when all your choices became a perfect balance.She did feel a little weak without Rez up, I think an E ability and the new GA bounce would have been needed for her.It felt good probably because you had the recognition for being On-Fire for doing it. Valkyrie can feel good. Think about it, you're damage boosting a mass of your party, making them an unstoppable force, and should one die, just bring them right back into it. You're leading them to win.... Unless you pulled out the pistol and started shooting, you probably have 1/4 of a meter. With that said... Probably feels very 'meh'. No recognition for it.The recognition was nice, I'll admit that. But I loved how the ult complimented Mercy's more passive play style back then. Making the correct choices was either go big or go home. Tempo was middle ground to it. Overall, I just liked the decision making in my hands, over having to rez my team like a bot during Valkyrie.  Not saying Valkyrie isn't fun, just old rez put a lot more power into your hands. Gave you more of a direct impact. Valkyrie is a lot more simpler to use, and has its annoying properties to it as well. People camping body's, you have no immunity like before, and having to worry a lot more about hitscans shooting you down with their ults.

While I didn't think that she needed to be reworked originally, I do enjoy Valkyrie. I don't use the pistol a lot, but I don't feel that I play a passive Mercy and I feel that Valkyrie let's me contribute more to the over all team fight. Using it to hold a point or push a choke or something feels great especially when it's frantic and everyone's working together. Rez for me has always been something to keep in my back pocket rather then something I want to use. When it was just an ult I'd usually only rez 1-2 people to keep the team up. When 2.0 came out I used it all the time because it was there to use, but that was just broken. Now, it's back to being a tool I mainly utilize during Valkyrie."

An easy hero for new players to get a handle on. But then if you actually chose her as a main, you'd delve into the intense decision making and ducking/dodging that came with the more thorough Mercy players. Should I rez? Do I need to remove myself in case of a team wiping ult? Do I attempt to heal that person or let them go down without the possibility of rez?

I love Valkyrie and the plays I can make with it. If anything, new Mercy (and yes this includes nerfed, casttime rez) feels more satisfying to play and more rewarding when you're actually doing a good job and are on point and it makes other supports feel like they are massively lacking.Even though I miss how exciting it was to fly in and get a great rez, I don't get how many Mercy mains don't love how she has more survivability. My average deaths have gone down. She's got valk now, and this great bunny hop. Shes great at pushing into points with valk. Valk gives you a great point of view to take down pharah and widow if you see her first. I get plenty of rezzes still, even with the cast time. I loved old Mercy A LOT. She's the reason I bought the game, but she had 1 job. Work up the rez to allow your team a second chance. Valk provides more opportunities. It's a 20 second ultimate support ability. Damage boosting, healing, self defense, escape, rezzing, great view of the field, speed, etc etc. I expect the next change to be with valk. I feel for the revert crowd. I do, I was there for a little while, but I had to cast my vote with mercy 2 when I could blow my ult to save my !@# to keep my team up. I'm supporting my team even better."

It's like comparing a heap of garbage to just a regular bag of garbage.Old Bastion had no survivability and no use. Recon mode was awful and sentry mode was also awful. Bastion never had a chance to heal because they would die too quickly before finding a spot to heal. The only thing objectively better about Bastion was their ultimate and their capability to kill close-ranged DPS.Current Bastion can actually attempt escapes now with faster transformations and healing on the go. Recon mode doesn't feel like Soldier 76 in a wheelchair and turret form is still capable of tearing through tanks and destroying barriers. Their ultimate is slightly worse, but it was already pretty bad to begin with. Effectively I feel like it's still in the same place because the slight change to their healthpool doesn't really mean anything in the grand scheme of things; Bastion is still going to instantly die the second one stun hits them and everyone looks at them.By far, current Bastion is on the right track. They just still need actual buffs and the dev team need to let Bastion actually try to stand on their two feet for awhile. I cannot to this day understand why they would nerf Bastion two days after launch so significantly. Literally no one on live had time to adapt before it was decided ""actually it's unfair that Bastion can 1v1 some heroes sometimes if they set up in the right place, time to nerf them."""

This is excluding ultimates.Mercy heals 20hp/s after a one-second buffer.Moira heals through damaging, at 33hp/s, or with her 10-second CD orb that does 75hp/s for a maximum of 300 HP healed in total/heals any ally near it who is damaged.Lucio heals for 12hp/s only with the correct song which has a .8-second CD to swap between the two, and does 35hp/s for three seconds on a 12-second CD.Zenyatta heals 30 shields/second after not taking damage for three seconds. This cannot heal his 50 hp, only his 150 shields.Ana can only heal herself with her grenade that has a 10-second CD, and it heals 100hp for anyone within the radius of it, but also damages enemies, buffs healing recieved for all allied targets and prevents enemies from receiving any form of healing for four seconds.Symmetra has less shields than Zenyatta, with 100, only able to heal 30hp/s after not getting hit for three seconds._____Now, I'm wondering this: why does Mercy ( and now Moira ) have such overpowered self-healing compared to the other supports? I'm probably one of the only people that want Moira's self-healing through her damage nerfed ( preferably halved, that way it's between Mercy and shields in some sense ), Mercy's self-healing nerfed ( and not work how it does in her ult, just keep it the same normally ), and Ana, Zenyatta and Lucio's self-healing buffed.I suggest that Mercy's self healing change to two second wait time for 10 or 15hp/s ( and not always heal during her ult ). People argue that ""she's a support, she has no defense by herself and needs it"". This is false. She has a gun, she has teammates. Just because she's in a solo situation by herself does not automatically mean she's allowed to have the most powerful healing in the game. Put anyone else in that situation. They work out just fine, and so can Mercy, but she has more self-healing instead of damage, despite her damage still being pretty decent.Preferably I'd like Ana to have something similar to Mercy's self-healing, but on a nerfed scale, and her grenade's healing and damage nerfed a bit, but keep the cooldown the same. Ana has self-healing on a ten-second cooldown, and she must choose to either use it on herself, an enemy, or her teammates. This is ridiculous.Lucio's self-healing is a constant passive so long as he has his healing up and not his speed boost. He doesn't even get healed for as much as he can heal others, and I have to wonder why this is.Moira should not heal for as much as she does. ""Requiring aim for her to heal"" is not a trade-off argument in this situation, because she HAS to aim in order to get her primary ally healing back. With a little bit of practice it seems anyone can play her pretty well; she's easy to pick up and is a main healer like Mercy, but with much more damage and self-healing. Her orb is fine in my opinion because she, like Ana, has to choose on damage or healing, but this, too, can be sucked up by D.Va or reflected by Genji, but at least she can just automatically start sucking the life out of enemies for her own self-healing, and on a massive scale. She's barely a support, she's basically just a hybrid of Soldier and Symmetra with Zenyatta's shtick of harmony/discord and orbs. I'm probably one of the only people that want her nerfed.Zenyatta and Symmetra are a different matter entirely. Neither of them can fully heal themselves, and must wait three seconds without being hit to even start the process. You get hit? Good luck, another three seconds. They have no mobility. Zenyatta has it even less than Symmetra does in some sense because Symmetra has a shield ability she can throw out, and her turrets for some protection, but Zen does not. There's clear differences between the two and that's damage and support ability; Symmetra buffs teams, Zenyatta debuffs enemies. Their damage is similar, but Zen without his orb does more, has range, but is projectile VS Symmetra's ( knowingly-bugged ) lock-on beam that cannot be reflected or headshot. The pair need something that isn't shields for self-healing. It would feel wrong giving both of them something that isn't shields in my opinion; Zen could have an auto-repair thing like Bastion does, and Symmetra could just have self-healing like Mercy, but still give shields with her ult. Hell, you could even let Zenyatta orb himself, but then that'd be a similar situation to Ana: self or ally.Just my quickly thought-up two cents.TL;DR- Nerf Moira and Mercy self-healing.- Give Ana and Symmetra similar regen qualities like Mercy and remove Symmetra's starting shields in favor of just pure HP.- Have Lucio's self-healing buffed.- Remove Zenyatta's shields and add pure HP, and give him a self-repair like Bastion, or let him orb himself."

Let's not forget it takes a whole second to heal 20hp, it's only 1 hp more than a 76 bullet. Provided you can shoot her every second she won't regenerate hp.Yes, Moira get 33 hp/s, but literally any dps worth their salt can kill her faster than she can regenerate. If she has her Orb up. Retreat, swallow your pride and fall back. Don't want her to regen hp? Attack from behind a shield, she'll either have to get past the shield, waste her orb or run. And she can't take 2 people on at once alone.Yes, Ana gets 100 hp/nade and the nade takes 10 seconds to cooldown. BUT the nade is a game changing ability as it can block all healing for 3 seconds. (except shield regen)  and can deny Life saving healing and can add a 1.5* multiplier to allied healing which is huge. If she didn't have to use it to heal herself, the effect would be staggering.Zenyatta has shields as He's a combat/dps hybrid along with Moira. Both have 30hp/s healing as they're expected to dip in and out  of combat frequently having toned down healing would lower his uptimes as he's already slow and very weak to dive.Lucio has weak healing as he has plenty of other tools to escape his enemies. He can speed away after booping enemies and wallriding further increases his ability to escape. Compare and contrast to Moira who only has 1 fade on a 6 second CD and almost every DPS has a way of keeping up with her should they decide to give chase but has a stronger 33hp/s healing to compensate.Lastly there's Symmetra. She's nothing special, not a trained war veteran, doesn't have any special healing technology to patch her up. Her Shields and Light constructs are all she has. Removing her shield hp and replacing it with normal hp would not only change a large part if the character it would also make her less susceptible to sombra's EMP, which counters a dispropotionately large part of her kit already as though they designed Sombra to counter Symmetra."

Self healing is not the only factor in survivability. Keep in mind, Symmetra and Zennyatta have significantly more damage the the others. Becoming quasi-DPS at times. A spatially aware Zennyata with decent aim can RMB one shot characters chasing them down, especially around corners and chokes. Meanwhile Symmetra's laser does a significant amount of damage, on top of her area denial with turrets, killing the Symmetra is not always as easy as you might think. Their self defense capabilities I think make up for their lower sustained healing. Also, Ana has her sleep dart. If she is getting dived or harassed, you can just sleep them. Yes, she has less self healing, but her shutdown potential makes up for that in my opinion. Also, Moira has to get very close to the enemy for her self healing, often that can be very risky, if the enemy team is dive heavy. For instance, yes your regenerating 33 hp/s, which is quite good. But if you have a Tracer diving you, you'll still die in a couple seconds, if that. That said, mercy's self heal seems a bit copious comparatively. Perhaps make it 2 seconds before it starts?

Her orb needs to not focus syms turrents, that's it.I don't think OP supports that Moira is OP in 1v1, in comparison with other supports. Moira along with an out of cds Ana need the most time to duel as a flanker. However, Ana needs her cooldowns to duel, while Moira not; In tight maps, like the controls, it's almost impossible to kill her (given that her team has awareness). She just needs a tremendous time to be killed, so she doesn't worth the time. It's better to kill fast other key targets like junkrat (for the shields), the second healer etc. Second she is the only support that can cheat death from dedicated flanker (Tracer and Genji) ulties with her teleport.IMO, Moira will be nerfed for sure, no matter how much we argue in favour or against her. The reason is simple; her competitive winning rates are just too high for a new hero and she has unreal average stats (combo of high elims, final blows, healing and low deaths). She is 4th (platinum stats) in Eliminations over Deaths ratio behind from D.Va, Torb and Zarya. DVa and Torb were always in the E:D first places due to their mechanics and survability.After examining the stats I wonder: Should a support have a place there? As you already know there are a lot of topics about Genji's and Tracer's survivability, but Moira is in a better position right now.There are a lot of people around who believe that Moira is fine. Can you support your arguments through statistics? Stats are objective facts, while ""a Tracer can kill Moira"" is very subjective, because this is a 6v6 game and not a 1v1 deathmatch. In papers, Tracer deals exactly 400 dmg with 1 clip if she only headshots. Have you ever seen a double kill against 2 full health dps with 1 clip? That's why stats matter."

Smurfing gives them relief, they dont feel any responsibility because they dont care about SR.

Smurfing ruins the whole competitive spirit, which actually defines competitive mode among other modes. THIS IS SO HUGE fail from Blizzard and their development team.

When you can and do significantly change rank on a smurf vs your main account its no surprise theres a massive increase in smurfs. They did it for season 2 and not again since which is stupid. I dont know another game (please, let me know) that doesnt reset each season and starts you from where you left off minus a 100+sr.While I do like this idea, not everyone would like if they had to start all over.But to me this sounds like a great solution.True, itll likely upset a few people but like I said, I dont know a game that doesnt do a reset, when other major games do I dont get why OW doesnt. Plus those that get really upset over it would likely be those that are likely carried and riding past season highs, as to paraphrase an argument thrown around alot ""if youre good, youll climb"" thus if youre a good player, youll get a good rank. A hard reset would have a !@#$show in MM, whilst a soft would maintain MM in that you should be placing against people of the same level from last season and losses will have you face lower ranks and wins would have you facing higher ranks etc. Point being, as it stands seasons are irrelevant and serve no purpose other than to give the devs some maintenance time or whatever hence theyre like 2-3 days gap between seasons.

Give an option to register your console disc to ONE AND ONLY ONE specific battlenet, or, if you bought it digitally,  to only that account once you link you psn/xbla account with a battle.net account. This way, you would need to buy the game again on consoles to be a smurf.Take Fortnite for example, Epic Games requires psn and xbla accounts to make and link to an Epic account, so they can control this kinda problem with no difficulties."

Out of the healers, Zenyatta and Lucio aren't great solo healers but have regenerating shields and a heal aura respectively. Mercy is a main/solo healer with innate regen and Moira is a main/solo healer with oodles of sustain, but Ana is kind of left behind in this regard, which limits her ability to be a main or solo healer.So maybe instead of just health regen like Mercy, how about when healing allies, each shot grants her a small amount of health? Not enough to make her immune or anything, but enough to grant her sustain to hang around without being a 10hp target for flankers or needing to abandon the team to find a health pack. I don't know numbers, but maybe 10-15 a shot, or a percentage of the healing done, similar to Reaper's passive.I'm obviously no pro, but it might help make her feel better to play, and make her a bit more viable. Can we at least try it out?"

Sounds nice, I am down. It will greatly help her durability over the course of the game. However in direct engagements it won't exactly be game changing (I.e. being dove by Gengu).Well, Zenyatta's regen and Mercy's regen don't save them when they're under attack, they just function as sustain. Lucio is already slippery as hell. Its job isn't to save her from flankers, just like it doesn't save Zenyatta and Mercy from flankers. She also has her sleep dart, decent damage, and her grenade if it's a tight spot.This suggestion is to help her sustain, which is sorely limited. Not just compared to other supports, but compared to other heroes. Other heroes have abilities or ways to heal themselves, many of them can afford to leave the team for a few seconds to grab a health kit, and all of them almost always have a support watching their backs. If you're a solo healer, you don't have any of that except your own sustain, and Ana doesn't even have that much.tl;dr it's not meant to be a life-saving game changer. It's meant to fix the problem of her having zero sustain."

I love sitting there for five to ten minutes waiting for a match, only to have no healer.  I 'main' a Mercy, but without a dedicated group, it can be frustrating to play with a bunch of rando's who really don't care about anything.  So I like to play different characters and work on my skills with a few of them (ideally I'd like to be proficient with at least one character from every role).But the last thing I want to do is heal a bunch of childish people who refuse to play as a team and work together.  It doesn't matter what mode you're playing in, it's still a team game, you still work together, and you still try to win.I think perhaps a role select at the top of the main menu screen where you could choose a Primary and Secondary role before being able to queue up for anything would be rather nice.  It'd let me pick, say, Support and Defense, or Support and Fill.  Something along those lines, perhaps in a similar vein to League of Legends.  Is this a perfect solution?  Probably not.  But something needs to be done about the selfish people ruining the match because supports and tanks are looked at as ""boring"" for some reason.  This isn't your typical FPS, and you shouldn't have that kind of mindset when coming in to play it."

I really hate when YouTubers like Stylosa recommend this and people start parroting these ideas. I'm not saying you got it from a specific YouTuber, but I'm talking more generally. Role select is honestly not good. Role select will increase queue times, which are already very bad for Masters+ players. Role select will also make it annoying for people who like to flex and it will generally frustrate people. Not only that, role select generally doesn't make sense in Overwatch, because Symmetra is ""support"" and Roadhog is a ""tank"". This is also a problem because it's not always people want to run 2-2-2 perfect comps. Sometimes we have stuff like triple tank meta or we run single healer, this system just doesn't work.Role select would net some benefits, but also come with some disadvantages."

Then people would feel they were ""forced"" into a role they don't enjoy if they want to get a faster queue. Which is more selfish, playing a hero you enjoy (this is a game after all) or forcing others to play heroes that they do not enjoy?If you want predetermined roles in your group, make friends who like playing the roles you'd like to fill. Stop trying to force people to do things they don't want to do. We may enjoy playing Mercy, but I absolutely understand how many people find damage dealers far more appealing than support."

Being able to flex to fill with what your team needs is a skill and should be rewarded. It is OK if you get punished for being an unflexible player who can only play one hero or one role.If everyone plays DPS, then being a DPS main becomes punished by the fact you will often have bad comps because of unflexibility. By the same logic, being a support main gets rewarded by being able to fill with the role most players cannot or are not willing to play."

I expected everything from people not wanting to listen to me, to be totally willing to discuss things as we played. Instead I was met by an immediate reaction to me being a girl because my voice is quite feminine and easy to tell my gender with. While I'm used to such overused jokes as go to the kitchen and make me a sandwich of which I try to have humorous response for so that they are more likely to be willing to discuss plays with me, this time I had people asking me if I would break their cherry because of my username and worse. Constantly asking me about sexual favors for the small time that I was in their until the end of the game. I'm not so much offended because of their joking sexual advances as I am frustrated because instead of being able to turn the game around to help us try and win I was completely ignored and what communication that we did have as a team was about them trying to get my attention instead of focusing on the game.  It's not surprising that we lost and it's because of reactions to my voice like this that I'm loosing interest in playing the game. I like Overwatch a lot, but the community is becoming toxic if it wasn't already to start with.I don't know. Are there other female Overwatch players getting the same kind of treatment from male players?

If it comforts you any, these same people would be harassing anyone else that tried to do the same thing even if they weren't female.  Anonymity lets people act like jerks without any real consequences, unfortunately.Try to find a group to play with if possible, that will at least let you communicate with a portion of your team.  To be honest, that's the best you can hope for anyway whether female or male.  Good luck."

I'm sorry you dealt with a bunch of stinkers.I've had some really awesome experiences with male teammates and I think in some cases it does help and people are more willing to listen to me because I'm female or because of how I choose to communicate with them. The best thing I found is to just match my language to the kinds of words they are using, but it doesn't always work. I think its more often the case that when I do try to communicate that I have people willing to listen or help, or just be completely ignored because no one is in teamchat, but there are still many cases in which people are being really rude to me bacause I'm a girl. I just get so used to it in games that for the most part I ignore it, but this time it was just really frustrating. The worst part is I shouldn't be at a point that I'm used to being talked to in that way while playing Overwatch or in any other online multiplayer game.

Overwatch has one of the worst, most toxic communities I've ever seen. I've been met with racial slurs, swears, a group of throwers who only palyed dps and kept yelling at me to play Mercy because I'm a girl (I don't play Mercy, I haven't done so since season two.) It's frustrating and prevents me from winning games - which is already difficult because I play D.Va and Lúcio and can't exactly carry my team."
