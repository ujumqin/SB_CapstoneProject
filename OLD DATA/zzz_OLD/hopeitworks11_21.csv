If it's one critique I'll have is that you need to remove ressurect from E and give the power to her ultimate or design a new E for her(damage % reduction ability on cast would be good).  The Mercy players obviously don't like this nerf and if you make ressurect too easy to cast and Mercy is in every match again you will have alienated everyone who isn't a Mercy player.It's okay to backtrack sometimes and a complete revert isn't needed but Ressurect has no place in this game as a regular ability."

But that won't stop me from giving it.The cast time is a welcome addition that helps give diversity to Mercys kit, making resurrect feel powerful in ultimate. The slowdown is counter intuitive to her mobility and her new core identity as a highly mobile hero with heavy constant healing.I say either lock Mercy to the ressurected target while she is casting so that she can still feel somewhat mobile and have a chance to dodge aroundOr remove resurrect as an E, up the charges in valkryie, and give us an upward mobility ability on E that could be replaced when she uses Valkryie.No character who's core identity is ""high mobility"" should be subjected to such a harsh slowdown. It just doesn't make sense."

If it's one critique I'll have is that you need to remove ressurect from E and give the power to her ultimate or design a new E for her(damage % reduction ability on cast would be good).  The Mercy players obviously don't like this nerf and if you make ressurect too easy to cast and Mercy is in every match again you will have alienated everyone who isn't a Mercy player.It's okay to backtrack sometimes and a complete revert isn't needed but Ressurect has no place in this game as a regular ability."

But that won't stop me from giving it.The cast time is a welcome addition that helps give diversity to Mercys kit, making resurrect feel powerful in ultimate. The slowdown is counter intuitive to her mobility and her new core identity as a highly mobile hero with heavy constant healing.I say either lock Mercy to the ressurected target while she is casting so that she can still feel somewhat mobile and have a chance to dodge aroundOr remove resurrect as an E, up the charges in valkryie, and give us an upward mobility ability on E that could be replaced when she uses Valkryie.No character who's core identity is ""high mobility"" should be subjected to such a harsh slowdown.

I am a Mercy main with approaching 300 hours on the hero. While I appreciate that a nerf needed to happen.. the movement speed and cast time nerf for the res is something that has completely ruined the character for me.The fact that a mercy has always been a target in games was fine with me, it gave dps a person to focus from the enemy side. The recent nerf to her res has made her such an easy target that whenever you go for a res you are most likely going to die for it. I personally never saw the point in the initial nerf as I was never a hide then res mercy but I can see the point from the broader populous of mercy players. With this nerf I really cannot emphasis enough how much it has put me off the game. While I can and do play other heroes my favourite was mercy. The constant nerfs are causing me to stop playing. Which is a shame as I have played a lot of the game and put money into loot boxes etc. I can no longer sit quietly while my favourite hero is destroyed."

Now, before anyone says ""Bunny just want OP Mercy!"", hear me out. What I like is that you initiate your ult and then, because of the lowered cooldowns, you fly in and rez people similar to how she worked right after the rework, only instead of the 10 second cooldown it's 5 seconds. Now, I believe on total mayhem Mercy can rez as many as 5 people during her ult, and that is too many for live obviously. But still, the mode gave me a feeling for how it would feel if she had 3 charges with little to no cooldowns, and it feels great! You feel like you make a difference, that you can clutch and save a bad situation. And rezzing feels good in Valkyrie. What I'm trying to say is that this has strengthen my belief that Valkyrie can be fun, it just needs that extra rez charge, and I think if we gave up the ability outside of ult a lot of people would agree that it's a fair trade. Heck, I would also give up 5 seconds of Valkyrie for this! I wonder if it's possible to set up a custom game that works like this..."

Still she needed a nerf but at the expense of her fun factor? She was nerfed to the point that EVERY hero in the game counters her now not just a few flankers and really skilled players that can pick her off. Nope horrible players and pros alike and with any hero no less.I mean she's just standing there.

CONS: Said that, her gameplay now feels really unsatisfying and underpowered when you consider that she was suposed to be a fast mobility hero but gets a high mobility penalty on an redesign ability that was fun and strong if coordinated and that made her gameplay more agressive and ...well.. better because she has a new skill ir her rotation. Possible fixes: Make the mobility penalty lower or non-existent (so we can at least try to evade enemy fire). Redesign the E skill to something new (although i love the rez and suits her) . Cut off the cast time but make the cd higher. Or expande the reach of the rez (so we can try to get some cover).Mercy 1.0: It was great to mass rez, but most times i felt like hiding more than usual waiting the other team's ults to use mine. Now i have a new skill to make gameplay more versatile along with an ult that does the same, and both making me play more agressive than just hiding from the other team.Sorry for any bad part.

There's not really a TLDR, but if you want to get the gist of it, skim through the bolded areas.Hi Guys. I’ve been hesitant to post this thread, and instead wanted to wait until after Blizzcon to do so. There’s been a huge surge of concern over Symmetra’s place in the game, so much so that there are 3 Megathreads (all from people in masters, with obvious game sense) on making her more supportive in the general forum, and a reddit thread with 3000+ upvotes. https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759249296?page=1https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20758668065?page=1https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759257002?page=1https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759220930?page=1https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/7afy3b/the_change_for_symmetra_we_didnt_know_we_needed/?utm_term=b41127a9-d761-42ca-93eb-d750b12c3337&amp;utm_medium=search&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=Overwatch&amp;utm_content=1After hearing the recent Q&amp;A regarding Symmetra, it’s kind of clear that the developers are somewhat unsure of her place in the game, and so I’m hoping that this thread will concisely summarize her issues as well as give the developers clear knowledge of how to fix her, rather than recategorizing her. Blizzcon Q&amp;A:Any plans to make Symmetra more viable in competitive? Maybe healing abilities?Symmetra doesn't really fit well in the support category, but doesn't fit in defense either. In the future we might need to revist the categories to better accomodate changes with the game.Symmetra doesn't see much play in high competitive, but her recent toolkit change brought some interesting changes that made her more viable.Please, please, developers. It’s obvious you listen to us, otherwise a Talon Healer wouldn’t have been the next hero despite the massive demand for her. The community obviously wants her to be more supportive. Recategorizing her will not fix her fundamental issues when there are currently better, more intuitive options in the game for her niche (junkrat), as well as more supportive options for her niche coming as well (moira).From the Patch concerning her rework:""We wanted to address two main issues with Symmetra. First, on the whole, we felt that she didn’t feel active enough. Second, due to the nature of her Teleporter, she felt weak in certain situations on different maps and game modesTo address the first point, we replaced her more passive Photon Shield ability with a much more active ability: Photon Barrier. Now, Symmetra can help lead the charge on offense or help shut down a big push on defense by actively blocking damage for your team. For the second point, we noticed players would often switch off of Symmetra once they found themselves in a situation where her Teleporter wasn’t as useful. For example, when playing her on defense on an Assault map, players often used her to defend the first capture point, then quickly switched to another hero if that point fell. To help her feel more useful in more situations, we've given her an alternative to her Teleporter. The Shield Generator is just as important for the enemy to deal with, but is useful in more situations. .""This is important to note, as she is the most passive support out of all 5, and she is also the most situational. She is not viable on attack, as the intention of the rework. The first rework failed its intended purpose.You can read through this or skim to the bolded sections. While a lot of people argue that Symmetra is strong within her niche. That is precisely the issue with her. When she was most viable was within her Niche on chokes such as Hanamura, Eichenwalde, and Volksaya defense. There were numerous complaints on how hard chokes were to break through, so developers made several balancing adjustments, both to the maps, and characters who had either abilities or mobility to deal with the chokes. From that point onwards,  new map development gave a lot of alternative pathways and elevation that lessened her Niche's effectiveness and gave numerous easy options for counterplay, not to mention she’s not very viable outside of her niche, either.The point? The newest maps, newest characters, and newest buffs to heroes mean that her original Niche is shrinking, and her viability outside that niche is dismal if not compromising to the team. AKA: She’s not relevant to the current version of the game.The elephant in the room: She is the utility support, however, she is the only support whose utility mechanics are not readily available for use (speed, discord, damage boost) while the other support who has utility on cooldown has two highly active, flexible utility abilities that have a variety of uses that outclass Photon Barrier, and have less counters than her turrets do.  The other issue is that all of these support alternatives not only have better utility in their actual kit (not taking into account ultimates), but all the other support utility is in conjunction to healing. She was designed as a damage mitigating, utility support, that defends the backlines; however, almost all of the support in her kit comes from her ultimate, which makes her the only character who is balanced entirely around the merit of her ultimate- which is one of her design flaws, if this patch from Blizzard is any indication:Game-changing ultimate abilities were coming up a bit too frequently. This change helps keep them in check while still allowing them to be powerful. (universal nerf to ultimate charge)If a character is balanced around an ultimate, then it is likely that their kit is lacking. Symmetra has the lowest ultimate costs in the game, and can keep her ultimate up indefinitely. This should raise concerns as to what part of her kit makes this necessary in her design. They wanted her to more engaging in the rework, with more of a capacity for proactive and reactive engagement, but her kit has most of the most passive abilities in the game. Also important to note, if all of her her supportive merit is funneled into her destructible ultimates, she will always lose to Zen/Lucio, who don’t need their ultimate or to keep a structure alive to be supportive. Not only that, but her supportive capacity was originally her E, which rightly means that her original design did not involve a passive ultimate to provide support.Please, complete her kit. We know this is something you’re capable of doing. Within the last month, you completed Mercy’s kit due to the feedback of DPS mains. This is feedback from the people who play the character. Please fix her.She doesn’t  NEED  to heal, but she suffers from an incomplete kit as a support character. (if you need proof she's a support) Luminums videos show her potential as a support, but watching his videos often makes it clear to me that her kit is just not as cohesive as the other characters in the game, even the defense characters which skeptics seem to be convinced she is. His best plays are supportive plays, so she obviously has potential as a support. She just plays more like an offensive support, similar to Zen.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1GvmBQk8-shttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flWwBFCTjsUhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBbe7ylCy18(this was patched but shows how he needs high game sense, and to be innovative to a crazy level to succeed with her limited kit) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sJwuH1BMwY(this video shows the potential of team flanks at 4:10) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YhsywtY2OM(and this video shows why symmetra falls short as a support… she needs her team to support her for her to support them. She’s more follow-through dependent than any other support because she lacks support in her actual kit, but people will troll you because they see you as a “troll pick”) He makes great plays, saving his team from reinhardt ultimates, making team flanks, etc. But really, while that’s amazing, there’s not much he can do inbetween that except try to make picks. While other offsupports like lucio/zen, have their utility up (speed/discord) in addition to no cooldown, no ultimate options for heals (heal aura/harmony orb).Quality of Life adjustments for Symmetra are necessary, but if that is all she receives, she likely won't have a place in the game as the game evolves.The best, and most commonly suggested Quality of Life suggestions are:Turrets: Reduce the delay in placing and ""activating"" the turrets after you deploy them, as well as remove the slow that Symmetra is afflicted with when placing them.Ultimates: Let them be seen through walls for teammates, as well as willful deconstruction of her barrier generator so a skilled Symmetra can change her nesting location, similarly to how a widowmaker will change her sniping location. Let her deconstruct her teleporter to redeem some of her ult charge if the charges are running low. Also, allow her to build her ultimates on walls and ceilings at slightly longer range, so her setups become less predictable.(via AConstelle) Remove the 5-6 second delay she has on gaining ult when her Shield Generator is destroyed. The delay isn't there for TP, but it is for Shield Gen for some reason, and 6 seconds is a lot of time for Sym. Also the blue line indicating the Shield Gen's radius would be swell.Photon Barrier: There have been numerous suggestions for this ability. Increase the charges on it, decrease the cooldown, give her more control over it. The biggest consistent complaint I've seen with this ability is the fact that Symmetra has a harder time contributing with this support utility than other supports have contributing with their utility that is often on a lower cooldown or does not have a cooldown while simultaneously being easier skills to contribute with. This ability needs to be able to compete with an offhealing slot, period. It’s her only active support ability. The other point I want to bring up is that she is the only support who has a viable alternative to rez, which a lot of people are concerned about.[Moderator edit - I removed the direct call-out to the Dev team.  The Feedback here is greatly appreciated but the idea of the forums is a discussion among players.  The Dev team has access to the discussion and may take part in the discussion but the main focus is the discussion.  Not shutting this down just trying to redirect the focus :) ]"

More than anything it's to shed light on the issues that Symmetra is facing and how she's becoming obsolete with the evolving nature of the game. These ideas are the kind of ideas Symmetra players wonder about when they think of ""viability"" in the sense that other characters have that fall under the category of support, without boxing her into something as arbitrary as a healer. I've tried to limit the amount of ""reworking"" suggestions in this thread, but at this point, I'm leaning more towards it due to her place in the evolving nature of the game and competitive team comps. If you have an idea you feel is within her playstyle and will bring her viability, please list it in this forum. Ideas that have been thrown out:(Kyleesie Ideas)New Features to Existing Abilities:Photon BarrierChange the shape of the barrier into a sphere so it can block damage from all angles, and fully protect someone running with it.Health readuced to 900 down from 1025.- OR -Provides 75 shields to any ally it comes into contact with. The shields decay slowly 3 seconds after leaving a 5 meter radius of the Turret projecting the barrierReddit Idea:Let her place supportive turrets.(The issue with this is it’s not as flexible as other support utility and is too area based. Which in the end would cause the same potential problems as before)My idea:Her Glove as a Secondary weapon, similar to torb and mercy, unlocks a new ability under the primary fire of this ""weapon"": Photon Shield (yes, bring it back)Channeled ability, resource meter of 12-15 seconds. 30 Yard range. Grants 40 barrier health to your target per second. Can give up to 50 extra health. When not channeling, will degenerate at a rate of 5 hp per second. Barrier health is the same mechanic used in sound barrier and doomfists passive, which is why I suggest using this mechanic as a ""psuedo-heal"". This would grant her a place in the game as the only support counter available to Ana's grenade. She'll still primary play as a defensive dps, but this will give her defensive support utility that helps sustain the team and the main healer, without actually making her a healer. The way that barrier health functions, it would work somewhere between healing and the original photon shield. That is, that instead of providing a flat hp bonus, it would give a max of 50 ""bonus health"", but since it's barrier health, any missing HP would have to be filled with Symmetra's resource meter degenerating barrier health (like doomfist) before the ""bonus"" hp would apply.These suggestions, or variations of it, are the most popular on the forums. I’d even be willing to have her gun range nerfed, as lower SR seems to hate it, in exchange for more utility.Basically the same as her old ability, but not a flat hp bonus. Since it’s barrier health, missing hp has to be given before giving the bonus.Lastly, this is a quote that I really like from one of the other very well thought out Symmetra threads (Kyleesie's thread) that I really enjoyed.  This basically sums up opinion on why on why it may be necessary to give her a ""pseudo-heal""/stronger damage mitigation, while staying true to the developers vision for her. You don't need to make her a healer! That's the beauty of it. You just need to make her sustain to the point the team doesn't miss an offhealer :)Comments: I know the developers intentionally designed Sym without any traditional healing. However, while I respect their philosophy to design a unique way for her to function as a support, I strongly feel that her inability to heal (especially while classified as a ""support"" hero) negatively affects how players perceive her in the game. Simply put, Symmetra confuses people. New players are unsure of what she is used for, and veteran competitive and pro players don't value her utility over other support heroes who can actually heal. As a result, Symmetra is stifled by negative opinions, and those who choose to play her receive an egregious and unfair amount of toxicity and blame.Ideas added later based on discussions within the thread:Mohock Ideas: Letting her be stronger anti-mobility by having turrets affect things such as Dash/Blink, allowing her to set the base of her ultimate in a predetermined location before she gets it.Crestren Ideas: Allowing her to have more buildables, such as bridges, elevators, or structures that grant support to the team.Dr.Fate Idea:: Symmetra is granted a passive that gives sustain, similar to Lucio but exclusively affecting shield HP pools."
"120","https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759380928","[MEGATHREAD-UNCAPPED] Symmetras place in the game","1509803820","Here are some of my potential ideas that could improve her kit and make her more viable:Turret-Survivability:Give her turrets thermoptic camo like Sombras. The turret stays invisible until an enemy comes in reach, decloaks and shoots. After a few seconds out of combat they recloak again. This would allow for more flexible and creative traps and prevents Tracer/DVa/Reaper from shootgunsniping them across the map.Turret-Placement: Give her turrets the flying behavior like the shieldcore, but instead of getting destroyed by hitting a surface, the turret sticks to it. This would solve the immobility issue while placing them, they could be used to contest high ground more effective and they would be more viable to push a point. Bonus buff if they would start fireing midflight.Turret-Slowing: Slowing effects from the turrets (or Mei) could be applied to ""teleport""-abilities like Tracers Blink or Genjis Dash, resulting in a shortening of the traveling distance equivalent of the percentage the hero is slowed down. A 25% Movement speed reduction from one turret would lead to a 10,5m dash instead of 14m.Ultimates: Let her place the base plate of her ultimates in advance even with 0% on her ultcharge and activate them when they are ready. You would set up the base with Q and could change the placement at any time by building a new one in case you change your mind or they get destroyed. I would even disable their shields until they are activated so flankers could dispose of them quickly if discovered. Pressing Q with 100% ultcharge would bring up the same image as of now of the sg/tp and you can select to activate the existing base by looking up or build a new one by looking down towards the ground. This way, Symmetra players don't have to leave the battle for prolonged times to set up her ults at a good spot and they can be activated right as the fight breaks loose to get a better impact."

Mobility is uncontested in this game, and that's why characters like Mei, even with a phenomenal kit, are scarcely seen in the game anymore. Improving anti-mobility kits, especially when tracer and genji are uncontested as flankers in the pro scene, might be something this game desperately needs."

The only thing that can counter tracers blink is sombras hack, i think this game could benefit from one or two more.My proposed change would apply the reduction to the momentum of a character instead of the absolute velocity. This would also make it better against charging reinhards, jumping winstons and rocketboosting pharahs while the immobile character interaction stays the same. To balance this change the turrets could get a little bit of damage reduced to emphasize the support aspect."

On top of that, slow down and increase the size of the barrier a bit. That way she can give tanks a small break when their defenses get overwhelmed. If they give her healing, she'll instantly become viable.If they do the rest of my suggestion, she should be some where between a tank, dps, and defense. Giving her team more flexibility on deciding if they want to got single healer, tank, or dps, without outright hurting the effectiveness of the team."
"124","https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759380928","[MEGATHREAD-UNCAPPED] Symmetras place in the game","1509803820","I've played Sym for over 200 hours and she's carried me from about 1700 to about 60 points away from Diamond. One suggestion I've had for a while is to add a simple 1HP barrier to her turrets, as a barrier will always absorb the impact from blow no matter how much it does. This would prevent them from being destroyed by something like D.Va's ult, Rein charge, Genji's Swift Strike, Lucio's Boop, Junkrat's Concussion Mine, etc. It gives Symmetra more staying power because there are less ways to counter her turrets, which are her main mode of support, but they still only effectively have 2HP so any automatic weapon fire can still dispose of them quickly.Another is that Symmetra just needs to take less time to do things across the board. She takes too long to deploy turrets, which then also have to activate so around 2 seconds from deployment to activation time for a turret which makes her harder to use on attack since she needs so much setup time. Her photon barrier needs to deploy earlier in the animation and closer to Symmetra, there are so many times where I have perfectly timed a block only to have the Hook/Flashbang/Widow Headshot go through it and then the barrier floats away from my corpse.I also think an interesting buff would be to either have her alt fire charge faster or move faster. She has the only basic attack that goes through barriers at range and, while useful in its current state, can sum up to poke damage if they have two healers. I think allowing it to either move or charge faster would give Symmetra a better chance on attack as she would be able to deal massive, unforgiving amounts of damage to the enemy team. These are mostly just QoL suggestions, as far as I'm concerned. The only straight buff is the charge or movement speed, and I think that's pretty minor tbh. The only serious kit alteration I could think would be to re-add back the photon shield at 25 and let her stack that with her shield generator, with the caveat that the 25 shields disappear if she dies. That would allow Symmetra to have a somewhat better impact before she's able to get an ultimate up, but can be punished if she were to die."

In fact, I'm pretty sure if it wasn't for the range buff on her gun (which I remember prior to the rework no one really even asked for) players with great positioning and game sense wouldn't have even been able to climb to masters, because her standard kit (not ultimates) is really just that outclassed."

If she's melting low SR due to her gun, it's probably a good idea not to increase her killing potential (which is honestly fine). A sphere photon shield does little to support her kills with the low range of her gun, while it does help her team move forward. The glove isn't healing, is a unique mechanic, basically the same concept of her original photon shield, but now she has a way to grant team sustain when she's not dpsing from the comfort of her nest."

People like that cant even climb to plat with her.Sym was strong because there wasn't many strong heroes back there but with recent buffs to other heroes and new heroes coming out, her kit become too weak because whenever a new patch note come out, she is passively nerfed one way or another.Even Luminum has been screaming about buffing her. Aside from Luminum, Hoshi and Stevo, no one would be able to reach their level especially Luminum as his skilled plays are incredible with limited kit. But the level of blocking all the Tracer and Rein's ult, even using turrets to block Doomfist's Rocket Punch is extremely high, if you dont main her to at least Diamond, its impossible to do it.Recently, Moira is out and with her mobility, she can outplay Sym with ease. Believe me or not, Sym will start to fall back along with Torb (really, these two dont need to have their skin designed in WC, no one gonna pick them)Sometimes i feel i could have been in Master by spending 150 hours on another char instead of sym but i love her and seeing her at the bottom of the game and being hated by most of the community is really sad."

My issue with Symmetra is that her supportive potential is near non-existent if your team has no awareness. I included some of Luminums gameplay in my post to illustrate this. He was doing a phenomenal job attempting to support his team, but they weren't taking his openings and not letting him support. In turn, it was like he didn't do anything, even though he was working extra hard with his limited kit.Imagine if an entire character's kit was similar to Zarya's grav in the sense that it needs friendly follow up to actually do anything? Yeah, that's symmetra right now as a support :("

Someone posted this on another Sym thread.10/28/2017 07:26 AMPosted by ImWithDerpBeen trying to think of a way to translate more of Symmetra's architectural skills into gameplay and make her more interesting to play.BTW, this idea is focused more on making Symm more fun, not necessarily more balanced. If something like this does get implemented then Symm would hopefully receive balance tweaks to make her viable without being OP.---Secondary weapon: Hard Light ConstructorPrimary fire launches an orb-like object in a straight line that sticks to the first surface it hits. Up to two of these orbs can exist at once. Like her turrets, orbs have a cooldown but can store several charges.If both orbs are placed within line of sight of each other, a hard light structure is created between them. The type of structure depends on whether the orbs are on floors/ceilings/walls.Illustration of different structure types: https://i.imgur.com/ygMBfDT.pngDetails of different structure types:Bridges stay in place, allowing allies to walk over themElevators move between both orbs, carrying any allies standing on themAllies standing above/under a Power Field gain increased damage (and/or rate of fire?)Allies who walk through a Boost Screen gain a temporary movement speed boost (and/or a temporary shield?)Secondary fire deactivates active orbs/structures.The orbs can be destroyed but have regenerating shields to protect themselves like Symm's teleporter/shield generator.I personally like it as it does fit in Sym's character. It also helps alleviate mobility to non mobile heroes (like Ana, Zen, Mei) so she can play a role in that and help her team move around better. And it does fit as it provides another utility to help support her team as shes not a healer type, she supports her team with her utility."

I'm not the greatest McCree but I can usually land the flash + headshot decently often. Also genji isn't super bad if you play him right, the trick is to get her low enough to use recall before you've used your deflect, then time it right and deflect a full clip afterward, you should be able to finish her off with a shuriken or two and a dash"

If he is alone up there, he becomes a dive target. If he is not alone, it becomes much harder for them. It also becomes very hard for them to push as long as he is up there. On quite a few maps, if the enemy team can't remove the hitscan from the high ground, they will generally lose. But with dive comps, that becomes a lot easier, unless the soldier is supported. And Mercy is the most ideal support for that. A mercy that stands on the ground, near the choke is a vulnerable Mercy. And she also steals the other supports ult charge."

Method 2: Pick Ana as solo healer. This one almost never fails. Method 3: Pick Lucio and wall-ride 99% of the game while using speed aura.Meh, I prefer to go Lucio solo heal. It so much better.

Only two things seemed to stand out as perhaps a tiny bit powerful... 1. She's very survivable2. She gets her ult pretty quickly...which I can assume is what caused the nerf in the first place. While the nerf DOES handle both of these things, it does in too extreme a manner.Survivability was probably the bigger issue of the lot, but there are several ways that could have been solved. Reduce the vampirism healing from her right click from 33 to 20/25 per second, or increase the cooldown on Fade by a second or two. We were finally given a good soft counter to Tracer and Genji(and to a lesser extent Pharah) and yet they nerfed the one thing that makes killing them infinitely harder.  At this point I can't help thinking the flanking dps are blizzard's pet favourites and that's why they're always so powerful and have so little that can be done against them, but maybe that's overthinking it.I can only hope that this doesn't go through to the live servers, I don't want her stuck in the same bottomless pit that Doomfist has been basically since his hitbox nerf.

It's time we answer the call!!","1511330460","11/21/2017 04:42 AMPosted by GoatyMcGoathttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvqlmGK5bSY10 minutes in so far. Pros: You recycle your Orisa shield very well, this is good, you are providing continual protection for your team.Your positioning is good defensively for both pointsCons: You could get a lot more out of Orisa if you aim for the head. Her headshots are where she really shines. Piggy backing off the headshots, a great tactic is to use the orb then aim where the person you pull is going to end up after pulled and spam that location for good hits. Also aiming the orb higher allows for more shots and holds the enemy slightly longer because now they have to fall further. You may think this is a small thing, but it can mean the difference between a kill or an enemy getting away.Watch your flank and watch to see if your team is relocating their position, there were a few times when flankers were making their move to the right or left, and your team wanted to engage them. Follow them in and give them your shield. Once you mop up, then place your shield in it's normal defensive position for the next attack.There was one time when the enemy mei blocked your vision on the second point. If you see this, chances are they are trying to hide their flank, and sure enough, the enemy team went right and it caught you off guard.Lastly, and this point is very important: You need to tab key (not sure what button this is for the consoles). You need to see the enemy hero composition to know if you should switch to a better tank for the situation. Not only this, tabbing will also allow you to see your teams ultimates to know if you can combo, or that you may need to drop your ult if it's the only one ready for the next enemy attack.This last point is the best advice I can give you to improving your game. While on attack:Cons:starting with cons because I notice them right away. You are straddling the choke. You don't want to do this. You need to be pushing up with your team. Symmetra is holding down the left, so right side is a good choice. The enemy Orisa and Bastion are on the high ground (they have better positioning) your best bet is to have the lucio speed boost your team to the right and claim the higher ground to then attack the point. You spend minutes fighting a symmetra you can't kill on the right. Not good, your shield gets demolished in seconds vs the enemy bastion. Again, there is no point in straddling the choke. You are just watching your squishes die at the choke, instead of taking space (like a tank should do) to help your dps move into better positions to secure kills.@13:13 you finally push in, but this should have been done immediately, or with several attempts till your team breaks through.@14:50 you placed your shield on the choke, instead of placing it further up to help your 76 engage the enemy. Remember, again, tanks take space to help their team push in or secure kills. Place your shield further up to provide your team better protection, all your squishes are out in front of your shield, and that's not their fault, you have to have better shield placement on attack.@15:00 again, your put your shield on the bridge choking your group, instead of throwing it on the point to start to take space and engage the point with your team. This resulted in 2 squishes getting killed because they wanted to push onto the point, but your shield was further back.@15:40 you straddle the choke again. @16:04 two teammates are dead and you pop your ult. Not the best time to do it. Also your team is divided, would be better if they were all grouped up. You are the shield tank, your team is best when rallying with you. @16:40 I'm noticing you don't notice when your team is being flanked/killed via the kill feed in the top right. Tunnel vision can be a very bad thing in this game. Looking at the enemy team comp @18:03 Orisa may not be the best choice. The enemy reaper is building ult fast from kills. Her shield is becoming more useless against junkrat spam and Bastion. I personally would switch to D.Va at this point to attempt to stop a reaper ult, have the ability to fly away with d.va in case of rip tire, and DM bastion for pushing power. Not only that, your teammate went winston, not a very good pick in this situation, a Zarya would be better, but you could at least dive with Winston with D.Va. Also, you already have a lucio to help quickly push in.@18:26 NO! Your team got 3 picks and your shield placement was NOT on the point! You need better shield placement on attack with Orisa. You placed your shield and then ran past it, providing no protection to anyone. @20:25 You placed your shield behind your team. Not good. If you see your team push up, follow them.

It's time we answer the call!!","1511330460","11/21/2017 02:01 PMPosted by RichC11/21/2017 04:42 AMPosted by GoatyMcGoathttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvqlmGK5bSY10 minutes in so far. Pros: You recycle your Orisa shield very well, this is good, you are providing continual protection for your team.Your positioning is good defensively for both pointsCons: You could get a lot more out of Orisa if you aim for the head. Her headshots are where she really shines. Piggy backing off the headshots, a great tactic is to use the orb then aim where the person you pull is going to end up after pulled and spam that location for good hits. Also aiming the orb higher allows for more shots and holds the enemy slightly longer because now they have to fall further. You may think this is a small thing, but it can mean the difference between a kill or an enemy getting away.Watch your flank and watch to see if your team is relocating their position, there were a few times when flankers were making their move to the right or left, and your team wanted to engage them. Follow them in and give them your shield. Once you mop up, then place your shield in it's normal defensive position for the next attack.There was one time when the enemy mei blocked your vision on the second point. If you see this, chances are they are trying to hide their flank, and sure enough, the enemy team went right and it caught you off guard.Lastly, and this point is very important: You need to tab key (not sure what button this is for the consoles). You need to see the enemy hero composition to know if you should switch to a better tank for the situation. Not only this, tabbing will also allow you to see your teams ultimates to know if you can combo, or that you may need to drop your ult if it's the only one ready for the next enemy attack.This last point is the best advice I can give you to improving your game. While on attack:Cons:starting with cons because I notice them right away. You are straddling the choke. You don't want to do this. You need to be pushing up with your team. Symmetra is holding down the left, so right side is a good choice. The enemy Orisa and Bastion are on the high ground (they have better positioning) your best bet is to have the lucio speed boost your team to the right and claim the higher ground to then attack the point. You spend minutes fighting a symmetra you can't kill on the right. Not good, your shield gets demolished in seconds vs the enemy bastion. Again, there is no point in straddling the choke. You are just watching your squishes die at the choke, instead of taking space (like a tank should do) to help your dps move into better positions to secure kills.@13:13 you finally push in, but this should have been done immediately, or with several attempts till your team breaks through.@14:50 you placed your shield on the choke, instead of placing it further up to help your 76 engage the enemy. Remember, again, tanks take space to help their team push in or secure kills. Place your shield further up to provide your team better protection, all your squishes are out in front of your shield, and that's not their fault, you have to have better shield placement on attack.@15:00 again, your put your shield on the bridge choking your group, instead of throwing it on the point to start to take space and engage the point with your team. This resulted in 2 squishes getting killed because they wanted to push onto the point, but your shield was further back.@15:40 you straddle the choke again. @16:04 two teammates are dead and you pop your ult. Not the best time to do it. Also your team is divided, would be better if they were all grouped up. You are the shield tank, your team is best when rallying with you. @16:40 I'm noticing you don't notice when your team is being flanked/killed via the kill feed in the top right. Tunnel vision can be a very bad thing in this game. Looking at the enemy team comp @18:03 Orisa may not be the best choice. The enemy reaper is building ult fast from kills. Her shield is becoming more useless against junkrat spam and Bastion. I personally would switch to D.Va at this point to attempt to stop a reaper ult, have the ability to fly away with d.va in case of rip tire, and DM bastion for pushing power. Not only that, your teammate went winston, not a very good pick in this situation, a Zarya would be better, but you could at least dive with Winston with D.Va. Also, you already have a lucio to help quickly push in.@18:26 NO! Your team got 3 picks and your shield placement was NOT on the point! You need better shield placement on attack with Orisa. You placed your shield and then ran past it, providing no protection to anyone. @20:25 You placed your shield behind your team. Not good. If you see your team push up, follow them. You must react to your team with your shield placement, don't rely on them to react to you. If you would have pushed up with your team, you would have avoided the flanking pharah. Not sure if you noticed, but the reason why you got smashed that round was because the enemy team ran dive, and that counters Orisa hard. @24:00 you will notice on this attack, you are in the back, you aren't fully aware of your own teams position. This isn't good. You need to be leading the charge. You need more spacial awareness if you want to play Orisa on attack - and that includes being aware of your team, and when they decide to push.

Hope this helps.seriously this advice is extremely detailed and helpful thank you, i made a lot of mistakes but i am very glad it didnt cost my team the win, i did feel i used the shield for myself too much so at least i was seeing mistakes i was making but you gave a tonne of helpful advice and i appreciate it especially since i only really started using shield tanks recently.on some of the times you said i should have placed my shield further up i agree however at the time i was trying to gain some ground and then the next shield i shoot it up further to get to the point but thinking about it now my team were just going for the point instead of the gradual thing i was going for which wasnt too helpful of me but also the fact that the enemies were about to respawn so i wasnt really thinking right honestly i appreciate your feedback a lot because i know it will make me a much better Orisa, i am used to playing a less team based character(roadhog who is still team based but not nearly as much) so i need to lose my bad habits from that"

It is a sentiment epitomizing trust and the commitment to overcome.  However, tanks aren't the only ones who do this.  Supports heal.  DPS kill the enemy who would kill me.  Flex fill the gaps between, strengthening weaknesses in the comp while bringing few themselves.It isn't about your role, it's about your team.  Your commitment to teamwork.

Your willingness to push yourself to your limits, because you trust your team to do the same for you.Does it always work that way?

Personify him in the post. Or Zen would be another good one to imitate. Think of all the amazing things support players do for the betterment of their team. Think about how they work with all classes. For example: We will speed boost our bulky Rein's and Orisa's through the choke as Lucio, we will paint those targets purple for our diving dps with Zen, we will damage add our ulting McCree's with Mercy to help secure quicker kills. We will dance ontop of payloads with our tanks, we will risk being popped in the head by widow to rez our fallen brothers and sisters, we will bless or Diving Winston's and D.Va's with healing Orbs, we will harmony, damage stream, amp it up, and shower you all with Coalescence. We will break it down and transcend to counter ultimates! We are the support players of Overwatch! We keep you alive, keep you shooting, keep you diving, keep you standing, buy you as much time with heals so you can apply the killing pressure! We will never stop healing, never stop sleep-darting, never stop boosting, never stop rezing, Can't Stop! Won't Stop! Look at this team, we are gunna do great! Why? HEROES NEVER DIE! There is probably a ton more you can add into this, like ana's ult, symmetra's teleporter/shield gen, healing stream... you get it :)"

"476","https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759546504","Widowmaker and the power creep","1511236920","Widowmaker has been the first character along with McCree to receive massive nerfs, that made her unplayable for many months, and finally she got buffed to a point where she would have been a decent mid-tier pick back then.Except the game moved on, the dive characters who were always strong didn't get nerfed, while everyone else got mostly buffs, and as such over time Widow ended up countering less and less characters, while new characters have been introduced that counter her. Now she feels really weak again, like even the changes in the last patch she got buffed in made her a less useful character overall... Widow has a really low dps, her headshots are strong, but nothing else.A long ago Torbjörn got a buff, where he can hammer faster, and as such it takes forever for Widow to destroy a turret if it's being hammered.Bastion can heal more too.The healing output of healers increased: Lucio heals more, Ana and Moira have been introduced, who heal a lot, Mercy got a new ultimate that now does AOE healing.The amount of shields also increased.Winston can drop bubbles more often, and you don't have enough dps to break it before it disappears on it's own.Symmetra got reworked and got a shield, that's pretty annoying.And then Orisa got released... Originally she was pretty vulnerable to Widow, but then she got buffed, and now she has 100% shield uptime that Widow also can't break.DM got nerfed, but then now DVa can just ram you down, and kill you really quickly, offsetting that tenfold.And then Roadhog.He is a character whose damage got nerfed a lot, but Widow has such an unfortunate hitbox Roadhog can one shot her consistently, so that didn't really affect her.Then there is the E buff, that allows Roadhog to soak up multiple headshots, and get away from Widow. Like on average if you can 1v1 a hog it takes 4 headshots and a body shot.The overall mobility of characters also increased. Hanzo got buffed to the point where she is basically a racecar compared to Widow, you basically can't win a peekaboo war, because he is a lot faster, can jump and shoot, and wall climb and shoot, while you are stuck standing almost still.Sombra is a new character who is really hard to hit, with many mobility options, as killing you from stealth.Doomfist is also a mobile character, who can sometimes survive a headshot too, and all of his abilities disposition you, ruining your aim.And now Moira can dive you too if you dare to stand on the ground. And even if she has no cooldowns, smg does so little damage, she just outheals you.And even Junkrat got a buff, that allows him to dive you and burst you down with the second mine, before you even scope in.And spamming is now really strong in this game.Maps are really small, and are full of cover, while Widow is super squishy with no self sustain. There are times where I can't even fire a shot because I'm low before I scoped in...Junkrat got very strong.Orisa can fire almost constantly.And now Moira. Her orbs can poke you down wherever you are, taking down a large part of your HP and perpetually zoning you off without a pocket healer.And the Mercy rework:You never really wiped teams, she negates your picks without investing much, and if you get a pick in the back line that's probably safe to resurrect even with the cast time and slow. Basically you have to dodge a lot more, and during that time you can't fire, there are lot more shields to block your shots, your body shots are healed up really fast, and people have lot more tools to kill you, including healers.She is the hardest hero in the game, and she isn't rewarding enough, people achieve the same results with much less effort, only your headshots matter, only on squishy characters, and only if Mercy can't rez that.I don't know what to do about it, but she definitely needs some help."

Her counters are not really effective against her:- Winston can dive you fairly easily, but considering he can only leap once every 8 seconds, Widow can easily rappel out of where she is, leaving Winston in the dust to be destroyed by her teammates (considering you're positioned correctly). I'd argue she can even put up a good fight if she's got a Mercy healing her (which is unlikely, I know.)- Genji has excellent mobility and can reach her fairly easily, but if you manage to land one body shot on him, he'll immediately try to escape with his tail between his legs.- Roadhog's a chore to take out as any hero.- Hanzo has to arch his shots precisely to get a one shot. Widow has a hit scan sniper with scope. Hanzo will get severely outplayed by Widow in a 1v1 situation.- D.va can easily take out a Widow, but she'll get absolutely destroyed by your tanks and DPS after diving."

Imagine the following situation,Your in turret mode, shooting at an X target, In which, you see your hp deplete quickly from a reaper that is coming your way, So, In order to survive you Press E, to summon your barrier to protect you as you hold right click to heal the 200 you lost from reapers sneak attack, Reaper wasted all his shots on your barrier and so he now needs to reload, And this is your oportunity to strike and barrage him with your large minigun.Anyways This is just an idea i had from my own experience playing bastion"

I think if he was made to be more self-sufficient, he would also need to be nerfed to compensate for this.  But I also think this would be robbing him of his identity a bit."

Asia or America? I’m from Aus too and I’m generally around 40ms, connected to America as the region section.Oceanic servers are considered part of the America region. 40ms would indicate, if you live in Aus, you are connecting to PSE2 (Sydney).The best answer out of a lack of answers from Blizzard is this: server is full.Because OW won't tell you why you were sent to LAX1 or PSE1 you can only look at the basic facts.1) Everything is fine before you are transfered.2) It's always an entire match of Oceanic players.3) If you leave, you can instantly get PSE2 again.12 random people all having the same problem is a bit of a stretch. For me, it's further of a stretch because to get to LAX1 I have to go through Sydney. So routing wise, the issue would be with the last hop for AWS, not a hop more local to me (Canberra).Oh, and when I was still playing WoW, this would happen and WoW wouldn't skip a beat (I could play BOTH at the same time, under 20ms).As with Blizzard support, they're more interested in blaming our ISPs. Although so far every issue I've had, they finally had to come out and admit it was on their end.So the only conclusion I've come to is that the Sydney server is full, forcing a bad gameplay experience on us as it send us across an underwater cable.There's various reasons why I don't play comp, primarily I don't think I'm ready, but this is also a reason; I cannot leave a game where I'm forced to play with 200ms."

Asia or America? I’m from Aus too and I’m generally around 40ms, connected to America as the region section.Oceanic servers are considered part of the America region. 40ms would indicate, if you live in Aus, you are connecting to PSE2 (Sydney).The best answer out of a lack of answers from Blizzard is this: server is full.Because OW won't tell you why you were sent to LAX1 or PSE1 you can only look at the basic facts.1) Everything is fine before you are transfered.2) It's always an entire match of Oceanic players.3) If you leave, you can instantly get PSE2 again.12 random people all having the same problem is a bit of a stretch. For me, it's further of a stretch because to get to LAX1 I have to go through Sydney. So routing wise, the issue would be with the last hop for AWS, not a hop more local to me (Canberra).Oh, and when I was still playing WoW, this would happen and WoW wouldn't skip a beat (I could play BOTH at the same time, under 20ms).As with Blizzard support, they're more interested in blaming our ISPs. Although so far every issue I've had, they finally had to come out and admit it was on their end.So the only conclusion I've come to is that the Sydney server is full, forcing a bad gameplay experience on us as it send us across an underwater cable.There's various reasons why I don't play comp, primarily I don't think I'm ready, but this is also a reason; I cannot leave a game where I'm forced to play with 200ms."

Works in theory, but of course, if you're not meshing well with any part of the game, you're going to feel like you're not contributing.Mind you, you can contribute while having minimum numbers.  It's less likely, but a Sniper who only takes out the enemy supports is better than a DPS who has 4 Golds but isn't actually taking out targets.

You do not get to play with ""new players"" and win 80% of the time just because you are not a pro. Keep closer track of your stats. You will die a lot, you will lose a lot of matches. That doesn't mean you lose 80% of the time, it doesn't mean all you do is die. Pay attention to your k/d ratio (for certain heroes) and your win/loss ratio, not the number of deaths you experience in a day or the number of losses. I really think you will find you are doing better than you (seem to) think you are.you have played like 200 matches at a 45% win rate. if you ARE in a inordinately high skill bracket, you have to play more matches to drop yourself out of it. that is all there is to it. I suppose maybe your MMR is bugged or something, but that seems unlikely.finding yourself temporarily in a bracket that is too high is to be expected for some players. keep playing, the situation will resolve itself. or, if you honestly cannot handle it, then consider finding a game that caters to your sensitive nature a bit more, because it will keep happening."

The free weekend was a nightmare, every game had between 200 and 700ms of ping. But the worst part was... disconnections. According to some players in Argentina who created a thread in the spanish (LA), they've got disconnected from the server mid games between 5 and 20 times. I've played with some brazilian people and they told me that they have experienced the same problem. Other players from other south american countriea had the 200-700ms + disconnections after the last patch. A few CMs from the forum told us that Blizzard's net engineers are investigating this issue, but they also said that we should avoid playing the game (especially competitive). Despite that many of us don't play competitive, we have a lot of players who are in high ranks (diamond and higher) and reported to have lost between 300 and 500 SR due to disconmections, and what's more, the devs and MVPs told them not to play competitive for a while... but their SR decays for inactivity too!What was most surprising, is that some of us tried to connect to the NA and EU servers and we had LESS PING!It's been a year since Blizzard promised to fix the brazilian server and separate it from a new server in Chile. Latin american players has choosen Chile as the place to develop the server because it has a great routing (and many videogame companies placed their server there). Brazil doesn't have a good route, but many videogame companies added a server at Brazil so their players can group and play together without worrying about ping. There's also a language barrier that destroys the harmony of the matches, sometimes we don't understand portuguese and sometimes they don't understand spanish, resulting a confussion between teams. It's not common to find that all of the teammates can communicate in english in the voice chat.Latin American server is almost dead. Lag spikes, disconnections and constant high latency are ruining our games. When they've confirmed the developememt of the SAC1 server, we saw a light of hope, but it's gone.Due to this issues, players are getting banned for literally NO REASON. Yet we know that we shouldn't play comp when the server is saturated, but inacticity also results in SR decays. And almost all of quick play players (I'm one of them) are getting the -75% EXP ban. Brazilian players, even if its the place where the server is located, are having the same trouble too. SOME LATAM PLAYERS ARE QUITTING THE GAME.

Pharah is so easy to shoot for a scoped Widow. I don't even play Widow but I have fun killing Pharah when I do play as Widow. A scoped Ana with decent aim will soon be able to kill Pharah with 3 shots after they bring live the PTR damage upgrade to Ana. I think it's true that the Pharmercy combo is difficult to deal with but a very good Pharmercy duo requires a very good Pharah and very good Mercy to sustain in competitive. I actually think Pharah is in a pretty good place. Maybe in the future the developers will explore having other heroes who can fly, as Pharah does, but for now she's a very fun, viable hero and her unique ability to fly adds another welcome dimension to the multi-layered Overwatch gameplay experience."

He is an OK Pharah counter, with better aerial mobility than her (more speed and the ability to change directions instantly). His shuriken also travel 60 meters / second, compared to her rockets that go 35 meters / second, and if I ever fought a Genji who landed from a jump without changing directions, he'd die every time.

Additionally, since you would be in control, the character wouldn't be worthless 90% of the time like they would with the described lock mechanic.Additionally, if you remember the rocket launcher from HL death match, you remember that you could pull some fun tricks with those missiles.

Pharah is not always high in the sky. There are times where she hovers closer to dive targets or in a closed area, or on the objective itself. In these moments, Pharah is vulnerable to Tracer. Tracer can ""one-clip"" Pharah in an instant. Pharah is a pretty easy target for Tracer to shoot, in terms of physical model size. With her blinks, its easy for Tracer to get Pharah to turn every which way, without being able to catch up to Tracer's flanking speed and quickness. I like to double-blink under a Pharah and catch her out of rhythm, and put a clip into her. Pharah cannot handle a pro tracer unless she gets the jump on her and manages to track her despite Tracer's blinks."

They also made it so that these characters have to be pinpoint accurate to hit her, but she has generous splash damage.  In terms of McCree, he has next to know mobility, while she has the ability to duck behind a building or fly away almost instantly.  It's kind of ridiculous.

They gave both hitscan characters tremendous damage drop-off at range, yet she has none.  They also made it so that these characters have to be pinpoint accurate to hit her, but she has generous splash damage.  In terms of McCree, he has next to know mobility, while she has the ability to duck behind a building or fly away almost instantly.  It's kind of ridiculous.

Well, here are a few tips and tricks in Quickplay and Competitive.1. When you want to move your team to the point fast and safely while having your shield up all the time, don't have the shield for a split second and jump forward. After that, hold your shield up for only a second to shield your team (and alert teammates to group up) and move. Continue to do this until your feet away from the point, so you can just walk with your shield. This method allows fast transportation while also having some quick protection.2. If your have your ultimate, use this pair to quickly kill the squishies. Ult, Fire strike, and charge. Not only will it devastate the enemy team, but you also get a achievement out of it.3. Only use your charge if its mandatory. For example, if there is a friendly Mercy in front of you and a Roadhog is going to hook her, charge in so she wont die, and give you heals. Always look for opportunities to help your teammates so your teammates can help you. However, if you are in the same situation but a Orisa is Roadhog, don't go for it or else you are only going to get stopped by a Orisa and get both of you killed.Bonus Tip: Charge only if the enemies back is near a wallAnd that's all the tips I have, hope this helps.Thanks!"
"861","https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759556611","Can I Please Have Some Reinhardt Tips","1511341980","1: Don't let your shield break. Leave it at ~50 health instead of letting it die. It can save some lives.2: Try baiting abilities/enemy shatter by putting your shield down for a second and pretending to swing. It can save you from a flashbang/scatter, sometimes even a Pulsebomb. 3: Be really careful with your charges. Only do it if you know it's not suicide. Try using it to clean up a teamfight you're winning, or to protect your teammate, usually a healer, when someone's diving them.4: Don't be afraid to use your hammer. It does 75 damage per swing. 2 swings at the enemy DPS can give your team a huge advantage, and it grants you a lot of ult charge.5: Don't go alone. Your shield will fall faster than Hanzo main's SR if you try to go 1v4-6.You need your team behind it.6: Try mastering your predictions so that you can use Firestrike consistently.7: Don't be afraid to shatter. Getting a huge one is great, but killing 2 people is usually enough to swing the battle to your side. You'll build another one really quickly anyway.8: Don't be passive/defensive when pushing a choke. Walk forwards with your shield up if your team is with you. Make space for the DPS. Standing and waiting for a miracle won't really help much.9: Know how to position yourself, so you can shield your teammate when he's slept, frozen getting shot at too much, and so that you yourself won't die that easily because you were out of position.10: Don't stand on the payload with the shield up when versing another Rein.His shatter will go under your barrier if it's not touching the ground.That's all I can think of now, I might update the list if something comes to my mind.Hope you'll find that at least somewhat helpful.Oh, another one, when fighting against Junkrat, try having your Firestrike ready as much as you can. It does exactly enough damage (100) to destroy the RIP-Tire. And, if you don't have it, and it goes for you, try doing a very quick 180 when it's about to explode. Junk's more likely to try and detonate it behind you, so that you don't block it, and the quick flick can save your life."

It's a super hard skill honestly because you HAVE to balance it between shielding (And it's SO MUCH MORE FUN to swing!)I don't play much Rein anymore...but I did main support back in season 5. One problem I found was my Rein wasn't swinging at the people who were practically in our faces or if they were Nano'd. I Nano Rein's when we got people on us and his shield honestly won't do enough. If you got a Monkey in your face...you NEED to swing at him. He's just gonna hit you through your shield anyway. Plus you get to charge healer ultimates and let your shield regen. This also means that you gotta know when to not swing as well... You got a team behind you sometimes who can really use a shield in some cases. Don't leave em hanging. These cases would be like in a choke where a Junkrat is spamming.Also...Be sure to take up good positioning with your team. I've played a fair amount of Bastion this season. For some reason...I find that people aren't really shielding me. They take up positioning that really wouldn't put their shield to work till it's too late. They use the environment as shielding which is good but the problem with that is...they only need to do that if their shield is getting low. So...if you just started the game and the opponent hasn't pushed yet...you don't have much of a reason to be behind the corner (Unless they're about to be there...) Bastion likes to be where he can see...everything. If you can help him with that he can help keep away Pharah's and burn down tanks."

If you're any other tank on defense, you can shoot people at long range while protecting your teammates on the point or (if you're Winston) jump at the other team, mess them up for several seconds, and then jump back to the point before you get too low on health.With Reinhardt, you just have Fire Strike to try and kill enemies at long range with. Sure, you can charge them, but you'll pretty much be rocketing toward the entire enemy team solo, and you can't do that in a hit and run way which doesn't result in your death the way Winston can.He's great for attacking, though, since your goal as the attacking team is to all get on the point. Having a Reinhardt to hide behind as you advance is very helpful, and a teamfight on the point means that most enemies will be in range of your hammer swings and will have less time to dodge your charges."

It's no different to RNG item drops in any video game.just let people earn credits and give the ability to directly purchase stuffBoth of those options exist already. You earn credits from direct drops and duplicats within loot boxes, which you get every time you level as well as bonus ones from winning from the Arcade, and you can use those credits to directly purchase specific items that you may not have gotten in the loot box.Remember that Overwatch originally didn't have the option to purchase items as part of it's first Summer Games, and they  adjusted it on their own accord due to player feedback.

There is also no way to cancel it so once you've pressed E you're stuck in the animation (even if you got out of range by some chance which also causes the resurrection to not happen, while still putting it on full cooldown). So if you think a rez might be safe and right as you press E someone walks around the corner and attacks you, you have no way to escape.I hope they'll at least finetune the clunkiness of the current version in the future if they won't make more drastic changes.Edit: As far as I know this is false.

THIS. Imma quote myself from the megathread but this is literally the only way to make Rez fun and balanced as an ability. Rez should still be treated as an ultimate despite it being an ability. It should be earned.11/18/2017 08:42 PMPosted by Xian396Rez Ability:- lower the CD to 20seconds- introduce a resource meter that charges similarly to how her Ult meter charges (Healing, Damage boosting, Damaging, etc). The required resource charge will be roughly around the average Ult charge Mercy gains every 30seconds.- keep the cast time- tweak the speed reduction debuff (either reduce it/remove it entirely or make it so that at the start of the animation you start with 0% speed reduction which increases to 75% as the cast time ends)Resource meter will make Rez feel more like a reward than a chore. The rez meter required will make it so that an average Mercy will be able to Rez someone roughly the same time it takes for her to Rez on the current Live servers. While the reduced CD rewards better Mercy Players with the ability to Rez more. This way, how often Mercy can Rez is now based on the player's skill.Rez should still have some form of counterplay. And I think that the 1.75s cast time is very fair. The current 75% movement speed reduction not only seems to punish Mercy but also makes her movement and gameplay feel clunky. Tweaking the speed reduction from 0% to 75% during the duration of the cast time will make her movements more smooth, as I think the sudden drop in movement speed is what makes her feel clunky and awkward. But Ultimately, we should just remove the speed reduction debuff as the changes will make it based on player skills rather than a given ability.I've also talked about Valkyrie on the same post here:https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759545938?page=55#post-1096and further explained why Rez should be treated as a mini ult rather than a simple static CD here:https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759545938?page=55#post-1096------trololol sorry for the plug but I really think that if the devs are so keen on keeping rez as an ability, treating it as an ultimate is the only way to balance it and keep it fun"

The cast time, is fine, but the slow and the ability to take full damage while stuck in a, basically, static animation is awful. She was always portrayed as this fluid/mobile medic that would swoop in and take care of you but you ruined that whole theme and playstyle. You might as well do a graphic update to her and give her an additional 30 pounds, so that movement reduction while Rez-ing makes any sense.Some suggestions: - Reduce/Remove the movement reduction while using Rez.- Finetune the cast-time/ability to cancel it, PLEASE.- At least give her the invulnerability while respawning someone if she is going to be a sitting duck in teamfights.- Damage Reduction while using Rez would also be somethign to consider.-A new mechanic for Rez, rather than cd. Some people suggested mechanics like Torb's armor. That sounds great: Charges of Rez can be gained on Kill/Assists stacking up to 2( or 3, you decide).

However, the general conjecture of this thread pertaining to Mercy is irrelevant, I was responding to the OP, who was categorically referring to balance, not entertainment, which I already explained in my previous post.Also, I think the only thing that “votes” will measure is how kind we are to Mercy mains, the demographic of this thread."

What's even worse is that if you die during the rez, it goes on cool down and this cool down does not reset after respawning. You'd think all abilities would reset when coming back to life unless your trying to make this game a full moba rather than part moba.I find the cast time to be okay, but having it stay on cooldown when you respawn isn't. Another thing is that it still goes on cooldown if the rez target respawns just before you get the rez off."

I think she is in a good place now.  I can still comfortably rez in smart situations, but can no longer just dart into the enemy team and rez a tank, without worry.  That was never fair, and I'm glad it's gone.  Pocketed tanks still makes Mercy the best healer in the game.  Valkyrie is still one of the most fun ults in the game.  Mercy is great.  No more changes needed."

You fly on the point as Mercy, res the Mei, dei, Mei gets to hold the point for as long as it takes for you to respawn and/or someone else stalls, then you fly in an res again. That would be absolutely broken.I think people need to learn when and where to use res with the changes. I think a lot of people got used to the mechanic babying them and allowing overly aggressive and extensive maneuvers with no punishment. Mercy now has to decide her targets intelligently, and also find the best time to res them. These factors balance out the raw power output of keeping allies on the battlefield. There's some clunkiness with how the slow works, but I really feel that's just something we can all adapt to with time. I've gotten a decent amount of time using the new Mercy and so far I've gotten every res off except one, and that's because I entirely forgot about the change."

Though if this is the real reason then I think it's a bs reason. By doing this you're being useless and you can achieve the same result by looking at a wall.Anyway I'd honestly settle for at least being able to walk slowly (at crouch speed) to mask our footsteps. I don't think it's fair that every character gets to sneak around except D.Va."

I am writing it, hoping a mod or developer will see it and add a tally to the board in favor of a complete competitive makeover (if such a thing even exists).This is a game ALL about teamwork. Blizzard encourages teamwork and sensible team composition with their mouths, but at the end of the day they’re throwing six random players into a basket and expecting them to form a cohesive and intelligent strategy. I am a member of the small minority that believes most people in this game are actually smart and are capable of winning. In other words, I recognize the humanity in my teammates and opponents and I realize that most of us actually want a present and calm experience. Regardless of what we want, we rarely get it. We are shaken up and tossed into games, and we all just hope the right ingredients are there.Now, in addition to understanding that my fellow players are peoples with hearts capable of feeling pain, joy, and frustration, I also (and this is probably an unpopular belief) think that maining a specific class is bad for the game. I play a little bit of everything because that’s what makes me the best I can be. I have a complete perspective on the heroes. Blizzard wanted this to be a game where everyone plays everything, switches and counters happen frequently, and we all get along. I understand why, but they wanted too much. It’s time to let go of ideas that just aren’t working. Players won’t want to learn every hero or role. Personally, I think flexing would be ideal, but that’s just not the reality we’re in. I’m a writer, and I know how hard it can be to let go of a concept or an idea or a scene that you envisioned at the beginning. But it has to happen to the greater good. (Example: Rolwing, the writer of Harry Potter, has come out and said she wishes she paired Harry and Hermione together in the end because they ended up having better chemistry than Ron and Hermione, but she had originally envisioned the Ron/Hermione marriage, and she went with it and now regrets it, even going so far as to say that Ron and Hermione get counseling in the future!) Things change. Circumstances evolve. Holding on to things that just don't work anymore is unhealthy. Kaplan has said he’s afraid of adding role queue because he doesn’t want to force a meta. It’s being forced either way. A role queue wold help, but I believe the freshest answer to Overwatch’s toxicity would be implementing a guild system.I know I’m far from the first to suggest this, and this post is really just me adding my voice to the coalition of reason and introducing the idea to anyone who is reading and hasn't heard it yet. I played WoW BC–Cat, and (especially in the BC and early Wrath days), being in a guild was super important and super fun. It was nice having that camaraderie, knowing you were invited based on your accomplishments. It was a thrill to receive a message from a guildy because he needs a Hunter for a raid and he saw my gear and wanted to know if I had time to help out. (Imagine being asked to join a game because a guildy knows you’re a sick Mercy or Reinhardt or Widowmaker.) Guild members were nice to one another by necessity, and if someone had a problem with a guild member, they could leave the guild or try to work it out. Either way, minimal toxicity.I enjoy Widowmaker and Sombra the most, and I have a lot of hours on them. But I hardly ever play them in competitive because I know someone is going to think I’m either trash or throwing and are going to then throw themselves or just not take the game as seriously (i.e. the Mercy won’t heal my Widow). As a result, I spent seasons II–VI flexing on heroes I have FAR fewer hours on. I simply am not contributing as much as I could be for fear of my teammates’ backlash. On the other hand, it is frustrating when I pick off a Zen or a Mercy, and my Reinhardt just continues to wobble back and forth at the choke, or when I go for that sick 5–6 EMP, and the team doesn’t make a move to follow up. The root of the toxicity problem in Overwatch is that we don’t trust one another and we don’t have a reason to.Blizzard, I am leaving Overwatch until this issue is addressed. A guild system may be contrary to what you imagined, but I doubt you imagined the level of toxicity this game has reached. There are other real issues this game has such as the nerfs of new heroes and the state of Hanzo, but fixing these will not fix the game. A guild system will certainly not make the game worse. Implement rank-based guilds: Bronze–Silver, Silver–Gold, Gold–Plat, Plat–Diamond (Master and Grandmaster would have to be in their own tiers). Maybe a whole guild could climb out of Silver together, or if one member passes others, wish them luck and begin the hunt for a new guild. I don't know exactly how it would work, but Blizzard has smart employees. I'm sure they can figure it out.This can work and it promotes so much team spirit and positive reinforcement. I really enjoy this game, and I know most people do too and want a positive experience. We all want to work together, but there isn’t a system in place that let’s us.<U+2028><U+2028>(I’m hoping this is already in the works, and if it is I’ll be three for three on Overwatch requests/predictions.
