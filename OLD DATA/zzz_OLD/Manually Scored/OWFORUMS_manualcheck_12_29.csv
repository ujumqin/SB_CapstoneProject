3,"I'd be more than happy to provide more constructive feedback to you guys if I felt that all the constructive feedback that was given before had any impact at all.At this point many feel that this is where their Mercy feedback goes to be forgotten.This entire rework has been a PR nightmare, and honestly you've done a very poor job of managing it.I get it. Speaking to people and getting backlash for your feedback is hard. Believe me, I'm a doctoral student and I have to get patient feedback all the time. People get passionate and comments can get heated. But it's necessary if you want your community to feel like they matter and have a voice. I feel like right now, communication is extremely poor between the developers and the Mercy community. You've never changed a hero to this degree, so I'd advise you to step up your efforts to reach out to the community.",-1,TRUE
4,"This past Thanksgiving I bought my sister a copy of Overwatch, she's loved watching me play and adores the characters ever since the game came out. Now that she gets to play it herself, she couldn't be happier. I've warned her since she first started to stay out of teamchat, to not engage the people who are mean, and to generally keep to herself. She's 11 years old and doesn't need that kind of crap. Yet here we are.The two of us just came out of a match in which another person on our team was using bucketfulls of inappropriate language. Insults, swearing, sexual language, you name it. I asked him politely, ""There's a kid on this team, could you tone down the language please?"" And he just continued on with worse things. ""Your mom is a SL*T"", ""Grow up little timmy, BLOW ME"" etc.I asked him three times before I ultimately muted and reported him, and I asked the other players on my team to do so as well, to which one of them agreed.But come on you guys.I'm an adult. I already know the community is as toxic, and I know to ignore it, mute, and report when necessary. Those of us with younger siblings, family, friends also know that these youngins like playing this game. They don't need to be seeing this kind of thing, it's a nightmare. Just because some dude fresh off of CoD decided to be a jerk to a child doesn't mean kids shouldn't be allowed to play this game. We're not here to blame the victim, the perpetrators need to be held accountable. And it isn't even exclusive to kids playing, either. I know plenty of adults who are uncomfortable and more sensitive than I am, and some of the things others say really can hurt. Whether it's kids, adults, men, women, foreigners, it doesn't matter. This should not be happening.The behavior of this community is horrible, intolerable, and it is a problem. To Blizzard: You need to crack down on these reports. Get these players off of the servers. Ban them from the game. Keep chat logs. Allow us to capture proof of the harassment when we make reports. Do something to ensure the community is getting cleaned up.To the Playerbase: You need to quit being jerks for no reason. You don't know what people are going through, there's no point in making somebody else feel like a steaming pile just to boost your own ego. Just be nice.TLDR; Just got out of a match where a player was a toxic and  inappropriate jerk when there's a child on the team, this community needs to work on its behavior and Blizzard needs to crack down on those who are problems within it.",1,FALSE
5,"Turn her right click into a healing beam; or keep the ball, and increase its projectile speed to that of Zen, Mai, and Torb.  On top of that, slow down and increase the size of the barrier a bit. That way she can give tanks a small break when their defenses get overwhelmed. If they give her healing, she'll instantly become viable.If they do the rest of my suggestion, she should be some where between a tank, dps, and defense. Giving her team more flexibility on deciding if they want to got single healer, tank, or dps, without outright hurting the effectiveness of the team.",1,FALSE
6,"Posted by MicrøwaveThat Blizzcon response is worrying. They clearly do not know what to do with Symmetra, and part of me wonders if they even care? I mean a new category? What is that going to do? All her issues in her kit are still going to be just as relevant. They acknowledged she isn't used in higher ranked games, but then they say she's more viable because of her rework.... Well yeah thats true, any buff to any hero will make them MORE viable. But she isn't viable to the game as is.Exactly. What's a new category going to do? She' won't have a place in the game regardless, except at a lower tier where her gun ""carries"" because they don't have mechanical skill. In fact, I'm pretty sure if it wasn't for the range buff on her gun (which I remember prior to the rework no one really even asked for) players with great positioning and game sense wouldn't have even been able to climb to masters, because her standard kit (not ultimates) is really just that outclassed.",-1,TRUE
7,"I admit, scatter is pretty annoying, and no one likes it. Here's the obvious problem. Typical hanzo shoots scatter at person's feet, they die. Here is what i propose.Rather than reworking scatter, simply make it to where if a hanzo shoots at the ground below a person's feet, it registers as a regular arrow hit and doesn't scatter out. A way of accomplishing this, is to have the arrow bounce off the surface, and keep going for about half a second, and THEN scatter out. If this is confusing, here is a mental image. Say a hanzo shoots scatter straight at a wall. The arrow hits the wall, bounces, starts going back towards hanzo then scatters after about half a second. This will cause scatter arrow to require more skill, and it can lead to some impressive shots.EDIT: I accidentally submitted it early, and before i finished the post through editting, people quoted it.",1,FALSE
8,"Posted by BillHicksLets be real, you are crying about scatter, because you, like most people, think Hanzo should be a free kill. You are going to be really mad when they give us something that Hanzo can use consistently. So delicious.I think if anyone is getting mad, it's better to get mad at a justified skill-based ability (this rework) than to roll your eyes in mild irritation at a cheap ability exploit (scatterarrow)",-1,TRUE

23,"All roles are important. Its the fact, which ive said many times, you have insta lock dps who cant hit he broad side of a barn or go off 1 v 6 and die. Those are the problem with people who play dps. I had one game. We were defending and I was playing zenyatta. We had an insta lock reaper on the team which is fine because he is awesome to toss a heal orb on and let go to town and wreck. Well not this reaper. For example in the match, we had a winston jump the back line where I was. Reaper was coming from spawn so I tossed a heal orb on him, discorded the winston but couldn't hit him because he put his shield down. I turn back to my team to help with whats going on in the front lines with both winston and reaper in my sight lines. A kill comes up in the kill feed with the enemy winston killing the reaper. Even the winston in chat said ""......"". No reason he should have lost 1 v 1. These are the types of people who should not be playing dps in comp. If you wanna play and practice a dps, go to qp.Ive had games as zenyatta this season to where I would have 5 golds. There is no reason I should be out dpsing reapers, junkrats, pharahs, and even one game we had a bastion the whole game with the same person playing him.",1,FALSE

34,"Why does Blizzard keep treating Pharah like a second class citizen in the game?1. They canceled her  animated shortAnd no, that comic hardly makes up for it2. She has very few legendaries for one of the original heroesAnd not only that but they were low effort jobs, variations of her default skins. I wish Blizzard put an ounce of the effort they did for something like Sentai Genji, Cop Dva or Graffiti Tracer.3. Her new event voiceline is a slap in the face to Pharah fansIt's so short, low effort and more importantly UNRELATED to the event that it feels they reused some discarded voiceline they had lying around. 4. They gave her almost no personalityOk, I get it. She's supposed to be this stoic and heroic Captain America like character but at the moment all she's given in the game are ""mommy issues"" and ""wanted to join Overwatch"". How about defining something that's actually about her? She's an accomplished soldier, she'd probably have a lot of great stories to tell. She also flying in this high-tech armor. She could be an adrenaline junkie and seek that thrill by riding a bike outside of work. Give her something5.

She is not that hard to design skins forJust as Blizzard put a lot of love and effort in DVa's skins (which are much harder to make since they include the mech too) so they should put some effort into Pharah's skins.
