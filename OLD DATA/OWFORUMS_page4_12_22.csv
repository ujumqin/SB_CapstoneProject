I wish you all a relaxing holiday with lots of rest and enjoyment. May you get all the things you wish for, and may we renew our hopes for a better and more balanced Overwatch for next year.I also wish to thank the Blizzard staff working on Overwatch for enduring us despite all our criticism.

Even a good gengi can be countered by a decent winston. Tracer on the other hand... mcree is a high skill hero that few people can actually reliably counter tracer with, people rarely pick torb and get flammed when they do and sym isnt a great choice either (especially with moiras orb atm) , and those are some of tacers best counters. even the pros just pick another tracer to counter tracer and no hero should require you to pick the same hero to counter it. So onto Mei. Her spray already reduces movement speed but by the time it freezes an enemy they can get in, kill their target and get out before being frozen. Even though people complain about mei's freeze,  theirs a reason shes not popular in death match and rarely used at diamond and above. So now the actual mei buff:-1 SLIGHTLY increase her freeze speed or SLIGHTLY increase its range maybe 1 or 2 meters-2 Her ice spray reduces the distance travelled of movement skills, so once you start being sprayed, your blink/ dash/ leap/ jump jet/ doomfist/ boosters etc has its effectiveness (travel distance) reduced over time. It takes about 1.5 seconds to freeze an enemy so for every 0.5 secs you lose 1/3 of the travel distance of a movement skill while her chill effect is in place.-3 Icicle has a slow effect that lasts for 0.5 seconds. Example:  D.va is being sprayed by mei and uses boosters to escape (12m travel distance). 0.5s of being sprayed = 8m travelled by boosters, 1second of being sprayed = on 4 meters travelled by boosters and 1.5s sprayed = frozen.So in short, She should be the character that speed based heroes are afraid to get close to. This will also ensure dive doesnt become to dominant again without having to nerf any of those heroes."

They can't buff her freezing speed because people already think it's too fast as it is.And Sym will continue to be F Tier because her hard counters (Winston and DVA) are so prevalent in the meta.The others in the F Tier club need more specific work than giving them an extra of something like Junk."

"240","https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760766874","Does Winston counter Genji?",NA,"Just My perspective but,Because for most characters, a hard counter generally means either being able to consistently confirm a kill or forcing a switch (i.e. Phara against Junkrat, Reaper against Winston). Even for Winston, Genji's hardest counter, neither is true. Instead, for him (and Tracer) the definition is amended. ""You're not supposed to kill him. Just annoy him into backing away for a few seconds."" Winston can make Genjis job harder, but a good Genji certainly doesn't have to switch. He still has more mobility options than Winston. He has better range than Winston.  And once Genji has his ult (which he can build by peppering Winston from afar), Winston isn't even a threat unless he has his ult (which he probably won't if all he's doing is babysitting the back line from Genji).Basically, Winston is Genji's hardest counter, but he's certainly not a hard counter, at least not as the term applies to other characters."

If its defense then you shouldn't be diving a lot of the time.Winston jump CD is shorter than genji dash, also most winstons don't waste their jump needlessly. If the genji is an idiot enough to dash into your team you jump on him and you will have jump before he has dash and should be an easy pick. If he tries walking to your team so can you and you should be closer to your team anyway, case of wasting dash. You have a shield, that stops his ult charging. If you aren't diving you should have this up.A lot of people here think that you have to be killing genji as winston... you don't. If he's not a actual threat then don't go for the kill, if he's gone and !@#$ed off with enough health to duel you or is getting healed you shouldn't be chasing him., you've already done enough protecting your team and stopping a burst kill.

Well if Winston hard counters Genji, he ultra hard ultimate counters Sym, since he can basically obliterate her and her constructs at will, and needs serious misplay to lose against her.It's kinda true that in term of characters able to keep Genji in check, he's likely the most competent, and will force him at minimum to either stay at range, be careful with his cooldowns, or very confident that he can take down someone fast enough to get a dash reset before he's in trouble. To compare with other beam chars, like Zar, Mei, or Sym, he just has to not get close to them, and since they have no mobility, it's not a hard task .Edit: forgot Moira, who very likely does a nice job of defending herself against Genji (who naturally targets healers), and whose strong heals might help allies against his burst (maybe). Her orbs are also perfect for the times he's backing off into a building, although whether or not wasting a cooldown to maybe get him is another choice to make."

I personally don't mind buying loot boxes every now and then because I love Overwatch so much.Posted by RoamingYou average 1 legendary every 14 lootboxes. Opening 10 or so boxes every event isn't going to do much for you.^And like they said: If you play enough to earn at least 14 loot boxes you have a chance to get one legendary.

I just wanted to chime in, because there’s definitely some confusion around one-tricking, and we wanted to take a moment to clarify our philosophy as a development team.We believe players can choose to play any available hero during any game at any time, and that their choice of hero alone is not a behavior that should be penalized by our customer service team under any of the player report categories (including griefing, inactivity, or poor teamwork).We believe players should be evaluated based on their actions with whichever hero they choose. If a player disrupts their team by intentionally feeding with ANY hero, you should report that player for griefing. If a player is staying in the spawn area, refuses to attack the enemy, or refuses support those that are, you should report that player for inactivity. If a player actively refuses to play the map’s objectives or communicates to the team in a negative fashion, you should report that player for poor teamwork. If a player communicates in a hateful or harassing manner with ANY hero, you should report that player for abusive chat. However, if a teammate is actively trying to perform well on their hero and help their team, they should NOT be reported under any category.Players who inaccurately submit player reports in an attempt to punish someone’s hero choice are considered to be harassing or griefing their fellow player, and inaccurate reports make it more difficult for us to appropriately action the players who DO disrupt the game. We’re continuing to make improvements to our reporting system (which includes, but certainly isn’t limited to making our false report detection more robust), and we will continue to pay close attention to players who are at high risk of being falsely reported and taking appropriate actions to prevent it.Your teammates can respectfully provide their opinion and suggest using a different hero for the gameplay situation that your team is experiencing, but the final decision about which hero you want to play with is yours alone.We built Overwatch around the concept of teamwork, and we believe the game is much more fun for everyone in a match when we’re picking heroes that contribute to the overall success of the team. At times, this means we’ll be playing our mains; other times, we should be trying to help the team by choosing heroes that round out the team’s composition.

If you're team is uncoordinated but have more ""in meta"" picks, expect blame to be tossed your way whenever the actual source of fault is ambiguous. Expect to need to be perceived as better than average in your game sense and personality to be able to persistently play an off-meta character across all compositions without facing significant complaint -- any of which which in turn makes the game harder for you to salvage or repair."

If a player actively refuses to play the map’s objectives or communicates to the team in a negative fashion, you should report that player for poor teamwork. If a player communicates in a hateful or harassing manner with ANY hero, you should report that player for abusive chat. However, if a teammate is actively trying to perform well on their hero and help their team, they should NOT be reported under any category.Players who inaccurately submit player reports in an attempt to punish someone’s hero choice are considered to be harassing or griefing their fellow player, and inaccurate reports make it more difficult for us to appropriately action the players who DO disrupt the game. We’re continuing to make improvements to our reporting system (which includes, but certainly isn’t limited to making our false report detection more robust), and we will continue to pay close attention to players who are at high risk of being falsely reported and taking appropriate actions to prevent it.Your teammates can respectfully provide their opinion and suggest using a different hero for the gameplay situation that your team is experiencing, but the final decision about which hero you want to play with is yours alone.We built Overwatch around the concept of teamwork, and we believe the game is much more fun for everyone in a match when we’re picking heroes that contribute to the overall success of the team. At times, this means we’ll be playing our mains; other times, we should be trying to help the team by choosing heroes that round out the team’s composition. We won’t be actioning you if you only play your main, but we also don’t believe this is the ideal way to play Overwatch—especially in competitive settings.This is well written, thank you! I hope this gives players a more clear view on what is reportable and what is not. As long as the person is trying to win I don't really see anything wrong with playing a specific hero, but if the person is negatively impacting the game on any hero it they should deserve to be reported. Quite frankly I find it ridiculous that people could be banned by report abuse for only playing a hero."

Do you even try to counter the hero? do you work with your team to defeat him? you keep trying the same thing over and over again?1.- Junkrat counters bad coordination easily, if your team keeps going in the exact same place Junkrat is spamming your team is just gonna receive severe dmg if not die. 2.- If junkrat jumps on your tank and kill it, its entirely your teams fault for not killing him, he puts himself at high risk and you guys just ignore him leading to the dead of your tank.3.- Self dmg was removed because it was a huge drawback to him, Junkrat is suppose to dominate at close range and having the self dmg didnt allow that, people actually (Especially tanks) used to just walk towards him to make himself receive dmg and then just kill him easily. -- The Pharah comparison doesnt make sense if you are at range to dmg yourself     has Pharah is your fault.4.- If you wanna kill him DONT fight him at close range always keep your distance, at long range he basically cant dmg you, at medium range you just have to evade his nades and the mine since is slow is pretty inefficient at medium range. (i win against him most of the time thanks to this) -- You could also try to flank him, his hitbox is pretty big (just like Zens) making     him a easy kill if you jump on him5.- Junkrat CANT one-shot without his Rip-Tire or the help of Zen or Mercy (And even with their help he can only oneshot Tracer and D.va unless both are helping him) 6.-  The double mine thing... he is wasting his mines if he killed you using both, he just used his tools to escape making him an easy kill. (And again dont try to fight him at close range) 7.- Im sure someone if gonna come up with this, Junkrat was trash before his buffs i keep hearing people saying that he shouldnt had got any buff. Im sure some of them they didnt even play him way back then.The Most important thing Im sure that im speaking for over 80% of the Junkrat mains that... We all agree with a charge rate nerf on the Rip-Tire we know it charge fast but the rest of his kit is fine as it is. And i know the reason of this because when he got his double mine and the tire buff, the devs didnt put in consideration the charge rate, Pre-buff Junkrat was to inconsistent but now that he is, he can charge his tire easier and faster thats what they overlook."

"408","https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760626703","To the Junkrat NERF posts",NA,"This is a post I made in an another thread about his pickrate/winrate. I'll just c/p it here since it's relevantJunkrat start with 7.76% pickrate and go dow to 3.29% in GM, where his winrate goes to  47.42% to 57.76% in GMSymmetra starts with 2.05% pickrate and goes down to 0.86% in GM, where her winrate stays consistently at the average 59%, except on bronze, which is 56%,and as equal, torbjorn goes to 1.73% to 0.51% , and 52.96% to 56%, an average across all the ranks.Tracer goes from 2.45% to 7,76%  pickrate and 43.67% to 54.46% winrate, and almost the same ocurrs with genji, which goes from 3.00% to 6.54% and a winrate of 44.91% to 54.33%.With this stats, i can see Symmetra, Torbjorn and Junkrat Pickrates decay, but their winrates go up, where Tracer and Genji go to the Oposite. both pickrates and winrates go up. But why? The explanation goes into my mind is that the more up you go the ladder, the best you deal with the heroes with Decaying pickrate (Junk, Symmetra, Torbjorn), and the only ones remaining is the One Trick/ Mains of those heroes. Yet the GM/Master rank is filled with good Hitscan/Mobility heroes, with can be more effective overall.Yet i still fail to see in which point those heroes with a Higher Winrate and Low Pickrate are OP across all the ranks. if he is op, why his pickrate is decaying?The GM's and Masters fail to see how that hero is OP and choose to pick a weaker one?Thanks for proving that you don't understand what ""skewed winrate"" means. Torbjorn and Symmetra have skewed winrates because they are usually picked on 1st point of 2CP and Hybrid maps. Meaning, if the game results in a hold, they will both get credited with a full victory because during the entire defense round, they played that hero. However, if the hold is not succesful, people will usually swap from those heroes. And if the game is lost in the end, they will only get a 50% of the loss or 33% of the loss, depending on whether it's 2 CP or Hybrid.That's why they have unusually high winrates and very low pickrates. Same thing applies to their pickrate. For example, Torbjorn has a 0.65% pickrate in Platinum. That means that you would only see a Torb once in every 13 games. Which clearly isn't the case. Symmetra has 0.88% pickrate. Which means that you would see her once every ~10 games. Which also clearly isn't the case. That's why those are skewed. And as for the rest of your argument, it's normal that a characters winrate goes up as rank increases. Why? Because people in rank X don't play only versus rank X people. They also play versus people ranked higher than them and people ranked lower than them. To make an extreme example:Players in bronze play versus players in bronze but they also play versus players in silver. And generally, they will lose more to players in silver than they will win against them.Other end of it is grandmaster. GM plays against GM but they also play against Masters and sometimes even Diamond. And they will generally win versus diamonds more than diamonds will win against them. So you won't get much information looking at the pure winrate in some rank alone. But if you take a look at what happens with the winrate of the hero in a rank in relation to other heroes in the rank, that is a better indicator.Junkrat has the 2nd highest winrate and the highest pickrate out of all DPS characters in Bronze. Bastion has the highest winrate but Bastion also has 5 times smaller pickrate.Junkrat has the highest winrate and the highest pickrate out of all DPS characters in Silver. Junkrat has the highest winrate and the highest pickrate out of all DPS characters in Gold. Junkrat has the highest winrate and the 4th highest pickrate out of all DPS characters in Platinum. His pickrate is the 4th highest but they are all close (McCree 5.15%, Genji - 4.94%, 76 - 4.67%, Junkrat 4.52%)Junkrat has the highest winrate and the 6th highest pickrate out of all DPS characters in Diamond. Most picked is Genji with almost 6%. Junkrat has 3.86% pickrateJunkrat has the highest winrate and the 5th highest pickrate out of all DPS characters in Masters. Most picked is Genji with 6.32%. Junkrat has 3.54% pickrateJunkrat has the highest winrate and the 5th highest pickrate out of all DPS characters in Grandmaster. Most picked is Tracer with 7.76%. Junkrat has 3.29% pickrate.So, in essence, you see that even in GM, he still sees stable usage. 3.3% pickrate roughly translates to having a Junkrat on one of the teams that won't switch for the entire duration of the game in 2 out of 5 games. In every rank, he consistently stays at top of DPS characters with a very stable pickrate.For example, you take Pharah, which is a problem in some ranks for some people. She is the 2nd highest winrate DPS character in gold, platinum, diamond. Already in masters she loses a spot and drops to 3rd place and 76 takes her place. In GM she drops to 7th place in terms of winrate out of DPS characters. Why? Because hitscan skill drastically increases as you climb the ranks and she becomes very hard to play. Same thing with Tracer. Tracer has a negative winrate until diamond and masters where she is barely positive with 50.5% and on the bottom of the list of DPS characters. But then, in GM, she suddenly goes to 54.46%, putting her in the 4th place after Junkrat, Doomfist and 76. And that also makes sense. She's hard to get consistent value out of unless you're really good at tracking and have superior game sense (needed for every character but especially for her). In literally every other rank, you're better of playing 76 than Tracer. And that makes sense. But the fact that Junkrat is still up there even in GM suggests serious balance issues. More specifically, overpowered kit from which it is very easy to get value out of even in highest ranks."

I'll try to play devils advocate though.Posted by DarkCat1.- Junkrat counters bad coordination easily, if your team keeps going in the exact same place Junkrat is spamming your team is just gonna receive severe dmg if not die.I don't understand how that's saying he's not OP? That's just a feature of the character. ""Genji isn't OP, because he picks off people from behind enemy lines because of his quick mobility""The problem, as I understand it, isn't that he has area denial. It's that he can deny multiple areas at once through grenades, mines, and trap. Posted by DarkCat2.- If junkrat jumps on your tank and kill it, its entirely your teams fault for not killing him, he puts himself at high risk and you guys just ignore him leading to the dead of your tank.""He isn't OP because you guys didn't shoot him!""That's not an argument? You're just saying that because he did something risky, he isn't OP just because it worked out. You're technically right on that, but if Junkrat can jump onto a tank and then kill the tank before the tank can kill him or the other team can kill him, that's a problem. Since Junkrat can deal (at most) 460 damge in one second (assuming there are two mines thrown, the enemy is trapped, and he hits with one grenade), it's reasonable to say that's a little ridiculous.Posted by DarkCat3.- Self dmg was removed because it was a huge drawback to him, Junkrat is suppose to dominate at close range and having the self dmg didnt allow that, people actually (Especially tanks) used to just walk towards him to make himself receive dmg and then just kill him easily. Yeah self damage is to make sure you can't just run in and guarantee you do 120 damage every single shot. Having a guaranteed 120 DPS is ridiculous, frankly. Self damage existed so that explosion based characters would have to keep their range, meaning that you could theoretically kill them with a well timed shield or body block. Posted by DarkCatThe Pharah comparison doesnt make sense if you are at range to dmg yourself has Pharah is your fault.A comparison to Pharah is valid. If you're saying the reason Junkrat would die to self damage was because people would rush him, then that also applies to Pharah. People can rush Pharah down and make her kill herself on self damage. Range is irrelevant, we're talking about rushing someone down.Posted by DarkCat4.- If you wanna kill him DONT fight him at close range always keep your distance, at long range he basically cant dmg you, at medium range you just have to evade his nades and the mine since is slow is pretty inefficient at medium range. (i win against him most of the time thanks to this)In a strictly 1v1 scenario, sure. That'd work. But, in a team game, if your team is working together you won't be able to get that sightline on Junkrat because his team will take you out. You're not wrong, technically, but it's a moot point because it isn't a 1v1 situation.Posted by DarkCat5.- Junkrat CANT one-shot without his Rip-Tire or the help of Zen or Mercy (And even with their help he can only oneshot Tracer and D.va unless both are helping him)No one can one-shot unless it's Hanzo or Widow. That's a moot point.And he can effectively oneshot any hero below 340 HP (trap + 2 mines). Think the hook combo, while that wasn't technically a oneshot, it sure felt one.Posted by DarkCat6.- The double mine thing... he is wasting his mines if he killed you using both, he just used his tools to escape making him an easy kill.It won't matter if he has no escape after he's killed you, because in this scenario, it's a 1v1. If he's in the middle of your team, then his Total Mayhem means that he's still denying an area even though he died. There isn't a negative to that scenario. He either gets a pick and gets away, or he trades and denies area. No downside.Posted by DarkCat7.- Im sure someone if gonna come up with this, Junkrat was trash before his buffs i keep hearing people saying that he shouldnt had got any buff. Im sure some of them they didnt even play him way back then.I used to play Junkrat a lot. He always felt fine. I like his 2 mine change, but the self damage thing is kinda stupid.

If he's at range, you can see them with plenty of time to move, and if he's not in any danger then he's either behind a shield or he can't see what he's shooting at.You also pointed out the relevance of the comparison yourself by noting that they are both characters that prey on others mistakes.Besides, I chose Sym as an example because you were complaining about trap being annoying. My solution? If you know they have a Junkrat, check for traps. Either destroy them or pick another route. You know, the same way that if you know they have a Sym you don't just casually stroll through a choke point... you either destroy the turrets or you pick another route...If Junkrat is firing at you in a way that simply moving aside will dodge the projectile, he's not doing it right. If the projectiles land at your feet, you need to clear the blast zone, and with more bombs coming in at a very high pace (Unlike with Symmetra's RMB), your movement space is going to be very limited, which makes you vulnerable to getting picked off or dying because you tripped over a bomb that's been lying there for five seconds.Apart from the fact that some maps don't really give you a choice outside of going through the chokepoint (Eichenwalde, Hanamura, Volskaya), in Symmetra's case you do actually kind of just flat-out walk through the chokepoint. Carwashes are immensely inefficient defense strategies, they take forever to set up and are brought down in about .2 seconds with hard counters, and 2 seconds with anyone else. Symmetra preys on enemy mistakes in terms of her own positioning, and her ultimate. She punishes enemies who are thoroughly unaware of their surroundings and allow her to sneak up on them from behind, and she punishes enemies who do not hunt down her ultimate. Junkrat punishes people who play on the objective, because he doesn't -need- to see his targets, everything he has is excessive damage in AoE format. The general direction of the target is enough for him, much like it is enough for a Hanzo ult. ""Just pick a different chokepoint!"" also works against Symmetra much more than against Junkrat, because turning your camera takes less time than setting up a whole new car wash."

Just make it require skill.Moira's biotic grasp and orb are so low skill. Originally I thought she's going to replace Zen as my third most used healer but I got bored with her. I'd just go Mercy if I want to play without my brain.Heroes in Overwatch require game sense (""brain"" in your context) and mechanical abilities. Some less some more. Mercy does not need much mechanical skill therefore she needs way more ""brain"" than any other hero in the game. If you play her without your brain you are actually useless."

I would like to write to you today to discuss the current state of Junkrat's ability commonly referred to as ""RIP-Tire."" This ability is regarded as one of the most unbalanced and not fun abilities to play against. There are several reasons for this. One being that the tire moves incredibily quickly and can turn on a dime. This makes it basically luck to hit with projectiles and extremely hard to hit with hitscan, even among the top level. Also, junkrat builds his tire extremely quickly, which is not good for an ability which is considered overpowered or good. For example, Zarya's ultimate ability known as ""Graviton Surge,"" builds slowly because of how powerful it is. Lastly, an issue not brought up often but is very important in my personal opinion is that tire can ride along roofs. This is very broken because the tire can LOS(Line of Sight) the players and gives it plenty of cover. In addition, when it rides along the roof, it is silent and you do not hear the engine of the tire like you would when it is riding along the ground. I hope you guys take these points into consideration and make some changes to the ultimate ability. Thank you for reading Activision Blizzard : )EDIT: One final piece of feedback I forgot about Junkrat RIP-Tire is the range of the explosion. I feel the radius feels too large and seems often you are very far away from the tire yet it still kills you.

About the negation of ultimates,a widow or hanzo can stop most of the ultimates in game with one shot, where the ult caster will die of it, not so for junk, so i would not consider this a valuable argumentation.The ult is the main problem. Junkrat needs damage to stay relevant, even if it is indeed spam. Or heavy shield meta will be back.

It needs faster cast time. maybe 0.5 seconds.Stealth is nothing more than a glorified sprint key - Feeling stealthy is not something you're gonna be doing as Sombra, for some reason someone thought it was a good idea to have her announce her entrance when she exits stealth and for some other unforeseen reason, you have a delay between when you can do NOTHING. The bug where she had no delay on stealth wasn't overpowered and should have been implemented as a feature.Hacked targets can't be seen by your team very well at all - that dumb effect that plays across the heroes model when you're hacked is impossible to see unless you focus on it.

The bug where she had no delay on stealth wasn't overpowered and should have been implemented as a feature.Hacked targets can't be seen by your team very well at all - that dumb effect that plays across the heroes model when you're hacked is impossible to see unless you focus on it.

We can do this by the following:1) Reduce spread so her DPS is more reliable2) Get a Hack reset every time she kills someone so she can Hack more often3) Stealth should become a resource meter to overall improve on consistency (not 100% on this)4) Every ability Sombra has SHOULD NOT have a delay5) Sugar Skulls on hacked enemies would make the world go round for Sombra6) Fix ALL SEVEN bugs that Sombra has so she can be at least functional"

Most people do not react in .2-.3 seconds at all. Plus they have to notice first in order to react at all. Hack is an amazing ability and is what makes Sombra a good duelist actually. The only buff hack needs is the ability to affect passives. Mercy in Valk can be killed easier with no regen, Lucio can't stall without wall ride making him hard to hit, and Genji can't double jump or climb away from a fight. This would make Sombra the one true counter to mobility heroes and I think it would be a great buff.Weapon spread is horrible, but 30% is a bit much with how many shots she has. Id say 15% spread reduction will do since she can still do good dmg. We don't really need her to be a Tank buster on poor Zarya.For stealth, you are completely wrong. It not just lets you run fast, but you can stall an objective for a bit with people not noticing and you can pick off supports easily. (Especially Zenyatta!) Her having a delay isnt a bad thing and her having no delay was a bit too strong since it allowed her to assassinate healers without a trail. Yes she should be stealthy, be hard to track and assassinate easily. But she shouldn't have no counterplay or way of to be predicted.For your last argument: when a hero has an ult and is hacked, everyone can see it clear as day. Plus, you should be calling it out either way since Sombra is meant to be an enabler character. She's a cross of support and flanker making her unique. But in the end, she is a form of support by her kit's design and requires coordination and calling out. You shouldn't have your team see it so easily that you don't have to tell them your plan. Sombra shouldn't be a solo carry hero and should never be buffed to be one. She carries the weight of your team, not the match. You give your team an easy game and open opportunities for them. If you think Sombra should be played for a solo carry environment, then you don't understand her design and play her wrong or ask for too much. Aside from that, you have a few good points and I do believe Sombra needs a few buffs. But the kind to make her a better enabler, not the kind to make her the new Tracer."

After this incident instead of disposing of his brother's body or checking if he was dead as all, Hanzo apparently just leaves his brother in a bloody pile on the ground, and walks off, presumably to get post-murder ice-cream. Overwatch just comes along, and scrapes him off the ground, probably in the matter of minutes, and they slap him onto an operating table to turn him into an Xbox, because what else would you do with a dying playboy? Apparently they were going to use him to fight against the Shimada clan, which of course never happened.Hanzo then abandons his clan that he just killed his brother for, and every year after that he breaks into the family-shrine to press f to pay respects. The security does not get better after 10 years of breaking into the same shrine on the same day every year for 10 years.Lo and behold on the 10'th anniversary of his brother's death, Genji is miraculously alive, you'd think Hanzo would be so happy to see his brother, his only family, and his best friend after all those years.Nope, they immediately try to kill each other."

I'd be happy to see Roadhog completely gone, but Roadhog mains don't want that so all I can do is shrug my shoulders and accept that I'll always run into him from time to time.

But people kind of hate on him just because.1. He has gone through the worst and the best of overwatch. I think we all know that XQC is always the person to get [removed] over by overwatch. Disconnects, bugs, really BS hitboxes and stupid rein shatters. Don't get mad at him for calling the game [removed] after he's experienced so many of these bugs.2. He says hes changing. Look, you don't turn from toxic to good overnight. Nowadays, he isn't as toxic as before. He also isn't being toxic to be mean either. He does it because its his personality and for his stream.3. People just think of XQC as this sorry toxic excuse for a canadian, and thats just crazy. Maybe before this was true, but he listened to the community and his personality is definetly less toxic than before. People think hes ruining the community and should be the next Dafran. All im saying is, look at things from his point of view, and give him a chance. Hes changed from the suspensions hes got. I dont agree with all of his actions, but generally I think hes not as bad as the community portrays him to be. Edited for language - Forum Moderator "

I will admit, that I am not completely innocent in the issue. I don't try to start any, but my response to toxicity isn't always the best. xQc to me is a child. He is very toxic, in team chat and when he gets fed up he's been reported to throw. He's given out false reports because he doesn't like how people play, and the one time I watched his stream to see just how bad he was, he was seen yelling at his team to  do what he wanted, and they still lost the point. He then went to call out a teammate who, from my observation was actually trying, for throwing. Now I am not T500, nor do I even play comp that much (I only have 68 hours in it compared to almost 800 in quick). I am a casual player, but I am a support main so looking at everything at once is just what I do, and xQc is good, but he is a very self-centered player. I can say, that toxicity only breeds more toxicity. Yelling quickly in the microphone because something isn't going his way, brings the entire team down, everyone gets just as fed up as he does, and could end with people just muting him completely. I can say, that if I was on his team I'd mute him. I can't stand people back-seat playing my character. Still, a ""Don't worry we got this next round"" helps team moral a lot more than yelling."

He isn’t exactly a role model for the community, but I do feel that quite a lot of the hate isn’t justified - it’s people jumping on the bandwagon; seeing clips of him being toxic or that one clip of him throwing and people hear others opinions and straight away think “He’s a di*k!

It’s just his character when he’s streaming, his pro teammates even say that he isn’t toxic, loud or hyper when playing serious and off camera, he’s an awesome dude apparently.

Mobility is so strong because the heroes that are designed to limit mobility don't actually limit it. Plain and simple, a slow should reduce the length of a dash or the force of a leap proportional to the strength of the slow.

Considering how long we on Console have been effectively shafted though, this was the best option I could think of.[Warning: Wall of text incoming.]If it was planned, from day one, to release the game on both PC and Console, then why are the concerns of the Console player base not being addressed, or at the very least, acknowledged? We had no choice but to buy the game for $60 (we didn't have an option of being able to buy the game for just $40 like PC does). This means that we are having to spend more just to be able to even get the game to begin with.Furthermore, we not only had to wait 15 months for a report system, but said system is super abusable. If you guys on PC think that the report system and automated bans is rough, allow me to enlighten you: it's even WORSE on Console. If we file a ticket with Blizzard as a result of a ban in-game on Console, we will be told that the Consoles have separate systems that Blizzard can't access, and will thus be told to file a ticket with Microsoft/Sony. If we file a ticket with Microsoft/Sony, they state that they don't handle in-game bans, only gamer-tag bans. This means that neither party knows anything with regards to Console in-game bans. Why are we being told to file a ticket with Microsoft or Sony, even though they've already stated that they do NOT handle in-game bans? Something has to be known from this so we can at least HAVE a chance to be able to appeal our in-game bans. Proof: https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759446940 Thread made by someone who plays on Console who has had to deal with this very thingThen, there's the 30+ things that we on Console lack (some of which are already on the PC version), and the extreme most part of those things which can quite easily be implemented. If all feedback is welcome, then why is our feedback not being addressed, much less acknowledged? Why are threads asking about when new cosmetics are coming being addressed, but not our consolidated feedback thread with regards to Console issues? A thread by the way, that has been going strong for over 4 months and counting. If elaboration on this is further needed, then I direct you to this thread here: https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20758447090?page=1EDIT (this was added on 12-19-17): Heck, there's not even an end-game for us. Competitive for us on Console really does not mean jack simply because there is no end-game. There's no OWL, Contenders, Open Division, heck; there's not even a single tournament that we on Console can even get that's hosted, much less sponsored, by Blizzard. Before anyone mentions it, yes I get that Blizzard has always been more of a PC developer than a Console one. However, they released the game on all platforms, and even had planned to do so from the very beginning. Therefore, this same care that Blizzard gives to PC, needs to be given to Console as well. Say someone on our platform reaches Top 500 and really wants to play in things like Open Division; what would happen? Would that person be forced to move over to PC just to have a chance? Simple little standard things like this really press home the second class citizen vibe that we console players receive. With all this said, can we at least get an update on when our current issues will be addressed please? We don't want our player-base to fade away completely because our feedback is not being listened to. The game started out very strong with the platform support, but now it feels like it just got dropped. I'm simply asking that we actually GET the value of the money that we spent on the game.If you read all the way up to this point, then you have no idea how much I appreciate this, because it shows that you really do care.Just to reiterate this again: I do apologize if this is the wrong way to go about this. We on Console have been shafted for too long now, and this was simply the best option I could think of to give our concerns.16 pages in now, and 3 weeks later...UPDATES:The ability for crouch to not be restricted to just toggle: https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760716093#post-13Ally aim assist for Ana: https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20759487829?page=2#post-35"

With that time, maybe you can work to afford yourself some more video games?[Warning: Wall of text incoming.]Keep in mind: I didn't make this thread to hear PC Elitists mock us (I'm not looking at the 'hur dur PC Master Race' posts here (you know what I'm implying); I'm looking at those posts that relate to ""Buy a PC you Console Peasant/2nd class citizen"", etc.). I made this thread to let our voices with regards to our platform of the game be heard.Consoles have more convenience in them, and the vast majority of us have friends that play on Console, not on PC. We're not blind in this community. Look at threads that get a reply from devs in this forum (not to be confused with mods here). How many of those threads are PC related, and something small (i.e. when new cosmetics are coming)? Sure, it's not many, but it still has the better reply chance. Now look at the other end: the threads that are Console related, and something well researched/documented. How many of these kinds of threads get a reply from devs? Practically none.To answer your last bit: yes I already do have a job. The reason why I don't go and buy more games is because:1. It's made by a company who is known to have greedy business practices (I'm looking at you EA, main Activision (so as not to be confused with Blizzard Entertainment), and Ubisoft, to name a few). 2. Overwatch is still better than quite a lot of games that were made even this year (even despite what it lacks on Console). If I come off as somebody who sounds easily tilted, that may very much be the case (I won't deny it). However, not only did we still pay for the game, but a good chunk of the things that we've been wanting/needing, we've been asking since launch (that's almost 19 months ago now). We still are as passionate as you guys on PC are about this game. We aren't even asking for a lot with threads like this one, and Biv's (linked in OP), to name a couple. We don't even get something as simple as ""Hey guys, we hear you loud and clear!"" on these forums, even despite all of our concerns. Yet, there's threads that ask when new cosmetics are coming that get answered within a few hours, and in some cases, even as little as 15 minutes. Look at how long we had to wait for our Report System (and this is just to name one example). We didn't even get a reply about when our Report System would be coming until 8 months after the game launched (this was when they hoped to have it in during, or even before summer, you see). When we had asked for an update in July, we get the response of ""Soon™"" (again, you know what I'm implying). Now you have 14 months past launch and it's still not in the Console version of the game. The Report Feature was not enabled for us until the 1.14 patch, which released on August 28th. That's 15 months gone that we've had to deal with being unable to report glitchers, throwers, etc.. I'm not going to so much use the term cheaters in this bit; a vast majority of the cheating that had occurred on Console were people glitching into walls to be able to prevent point caps making it impossible for the attacking team to cap their objective. So we had people that could get away with literally anything and everything and we wouldn't be able to do anything about it.You also can't justify the excuse of ""It's because of Sony/Microsoft"" either. Games that have been available on Console have already had a Report System available on day 1. Heck, Fortnite is still in beta, and it already has a Report System. Hope I've cleared up some of our situation to you. Apologies if I've sounded critical on some parts. As I stated though, we are still passionate about this game just as much as you guys are.What are you not getting?!?I was not talking to you. My post was to someone else. I think i made that clear on my previous post. You just got offended because I gave someone a christmas solution and your butthurt about it.  since you dont want to switch and that is fine.

Rien, Winston and Genji with their respective ults. I think we should get another! And I've got an idea! The idea for the kit would work like this:The primary would be some type of melee projectile, like a disk or glave that can bounce off of enemies and surfaces. Since not very many of the cast shoot actual solids (Torb and Genji are examples) I'm torn between whether it can be deflected or absorbed like those or be an actual melee weapon and cannot. I'm not sure about a secondary fire, as I planned for the disk to be charged like Hanzo to shoot it faster and do more damage. The first ability would be like a scatter arrow but act more like an explosion and would do all it's damage at once instead of separate fragments bouncing around.  10 second reload maybe? The second ability would be either a piercing shot or a shocking disk that slows and denies ability use for a second or two. The ult would be activated like the Supercharger. They place down a device that prevents critical hits to their teammates until a certain amount of damage is absorbed and then becomes inactive. It blocks the extra damage taken after the critical multiplier and ideally would show it's affected targets the amount of damage left over to be absorbed. I'm not sure what the ideal lockon distance would be but it certainly respects LoS and breaks after 1 second when you can't see it. This definitely needs work and refinement but I would like to see your guy's thoughts and certainly a response from the Team."

Posted by BivOnce this hits 200 likes, there is no denying that they ignored us on purpose, they want us to know that they are unappreciative of console players, they just don't want us to have as good of an experience as PC players, for no clear reason.Posted by BivThis is stupid, Blizzard won't add things that PC has, to console, that are so simple, after this much. Blizzard is making me feel like I am supposed to be disappointed by them.Posted by BivBlizzard has no reason to ignore us like this, this is unacceptable. They don't treat us like part of the community, they treat us like we aren't important at all, they don't want our feedback, they don't want to hear what we have to say.Posted by BivI paid for the game, just like the PC players, we deserve equal treatment, I'm tired of Blizzard's neglect.Posted by Biv I forgot that it costs more on console, more reasons to think Blizzard hates console, and only put it there for money.Posted by Biv It would probably take them another year to add a single thing from the list, that's how much they hate console.Posted by Biv Blizzard thinks it's ok to neglect this part of the community.Posted by BivAre you scared to respond because it will bring attention, and you will have to do SOMETHING for this part of YOUR COMMUNITY, so that more people don't think that you NEGLECT this part of the community? I am sick of it, I payed for this FULL game, NOT to get a crappy ignored version of it, because I bought it on a platform that wasn't PC, give me the full game or give me my money back.Posted by BivWhen can I get my money back? The console version is only worth half of it's price.Posted by BivBlizzard this is disappointing, if you aren't replying, you should at least be working on like 10 of these things right now. They can't even REPLY, they want us to leave, they want us to think that they will neglect the community because they are lazy, and will remove stuff from a version of the game only to be inconvenient. It's not hard to reply, AT ALL, but they want us to know that they don't want us.Posted by Biv It's gonna hit 400 likes, and Blizzard won't do anything, they hate us, and it's pretty obvious.Posted by BivBlizzard needs to stop neglecting their community, or they will lose even more people, they have already lost me.I wouldn't be surprised, if they ignore this, because of you."

And we have lots and lots of support mains in here as well. A mobility hero which is SPECIFICALLY designed to target the backline and kill the supports? Guess what their reactions will be. Deflect hitboxes and fast movements and every other argument they bring up is just an excuse to request for either a hard counter that takes little to no effort but destroys genji, or to remove genji from competitive play.I've seen countless posts of people with 5 minutes of genji play in TOTAL, claiming that he's too easy to contribute with and to win. a lot of players never play him, yet consider him an EASY character to play which rewards you heavily. Like i said. The reason isn't logical.I don't want to lump myself with these kinds of people. I'm a Support main and I know full well when I've been outplayed and when a kill/death is deserved. As a Support main, I am fully aware of everything around me at all times. The problem that I have with Genji, at least as a Lucio main, is that his Deflect hitbox is far too large. That alone is my only gripe with Genji. Full stop. If Genji becomes a problem to me, I can now swap to Moira to not only more effectively combat Genji, but also contribute to healing."
